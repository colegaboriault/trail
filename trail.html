<h1>The Great Walk</h1>
<p>
<h2>Marche the Ninth, Sultry Midafternoon</h2>
I am in the middle of a nearly twelve-hour car ride travelling the distance we intend to hike in about 90 days. Cars are faster than people. I've just discovered the existence of Arizona Fruit Snacks, the packaging of which will make a fine and dandy addition to my growing Arizona Tarot. I believe the Snacks are almost three times as expensive as a classic can; they don't taste like it. The checkerboard motif reoccurs once again on the top of the bag. I am convinced it is speaking to me. It is saying, "summersummersummersummersummersummer." It speaks in whispers and hisses, but I can still hear it if I strain my cochlea. Summersummersummersummersummersummer.
