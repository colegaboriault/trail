<h1>The Great Walk</h1>
<p>
<h2>424 Palindrome! Quick, Somebody Run Back! Double Solo Dark Innawoods</h2>
The biggest event of the morning (after my mom's delivery of the meal cooking stove to my hammock) was passing an undetermined number of tiny furballs scurrying among the meadowweeds.
I'd try to identify them, but they were so fast I couldn't get a clear look at the damn things.
I did see one leap over a leaf, from which I learned that they have tails.
Their mystique remains unmarred by my prying eyes.
As we walked down the trail to a lower and therefore worse altitude, we passed near a hôtel called Greasy Creek Friendly (not making this one up either, they really chose that name);
in another world, we might have stayed there, but they are closed for the sabbath and still require proof of COUGHID vaccination.
The next hiking segment (as opposed to section, a crucial distinction) was quite easy.
We hoped to press on at least partway up Mount Rone, but sadly Papa Bear had already stopped at an earlier campsite full of yahoos (Ninja's words, not mine).
So naturally I abandoned my mom there and pressed on five more miles to the summit, just uphill from the highest shelta on the whole trail and the highest I have ever camped.
The hike was Vermonty and featured some fun icicles and the site of a former highland hotel.
Sheltasigns informed me that I was in a GLOBALLY RARE ECOSYSTEM home to special species like the Carolinia Norther Flying Squirrel and the Spruce Fir Moss Spider.
Heeding their warnings, I hung myself as high as I could within the demarcated perimiter and enjoyed many hours of Summit Sleep: The Best Sleep A Man Can Get!
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/2=3 Is A False Statement, Solo Dark Solo Dark Solo Dark (drafting disclaimer applies)</h2>
As with most mornings after a decadent and idle caligulation, I was awoken before I was awake.
My oatmeal packet was still in hand during the brief shuttle flight to the Trail Head, or Tread.
Fast hike fast hike!
We hiked faster than a clam (the return to chilly weather patterns helped us beat those clams once and for all).
By noon of the hidden sun we were atop Spotty Beaut munching our lunches.
I walked with a slightly odd but good-natured southern man through the following meadows until we began climbing YouNaked Mountain.
The summit was deeply calm and mellow, which seems to be the case with all groves of hemlock;
we took our snack there.
Some sun popped out from behind the tropospheric hydronimbulations as we descended to a shelter.
I wrote yesterday's post as the rest of the crew settled in--but stopping was not an option for me.
I pressed on for about four more miles of pleasant evening trail to achieve a second Big Boy Hike, totaling 21.4 miles with 6144 feet of gain (notice the shallower grade as the terrain becomes gradually more boring).
I finished just in time to set up as the little sun man set the sun down.
Then I crawled into my sleeping sack and curled up for a cold night o' swingin'.
A sliver moon hung above the evening star.
Both shone on me.
</p>
<p>
<h2>April Twenty Two, We Doin' April Twenty Again, The Subsequent Evening After A Pleasant Meal (Oh Dear, I Appear To Be A Day Behind)</h2>
It was a very caligulary day.
The errands were as follows:
Haffle Wouse, Good Sporty Dick, WALL-E, the Outside Store, the Hoffee Couse, back to the room and board to get organizized, and the Hibacci House (run by white people).
None of this was particularly notable.
I did have to cough up 130 membership buckaroos for the idle cult that contacted me, which was unfortunate.
We ended the day by calling my paterfamilias while my mom and Deb indulged in some of the red grape liquor.
The shuddle ship was to arrive early in the morning, so early retirement was our weapon of choice.
Want more detail and funny words?
No.
</p>
<p>
<h2>April of Drinking Age, but the Afternoon After</h2>
We had a big morphing scuttling planshifting day!
Once upon a time, at the grand old beginning of it all in the morning, we set our sights on campin' and lampin' one more nighttide in the forest realm.
And we hiked and hiked and hiked, and it was hot.
In the afternoon we passed by a shelter where an ill man was lying in discomfort and nausea beneath a large graffito of the poem Invictus (both the clichéd content and ironic circumstance of the graffito amused me).
His affliction was just the latest in a long string of clues to the pathogenic danger that lurks within our peers--over the past few weeks, certain members of our community have been taken by the tummy touch, as they say.
Shortly later, we received notice that the ADL declared norovirus risk on trail to be "high as a fuckin kite" and simultaneously realized our intended campflat was only three big ones from the tiny town of Earwig, Tennisy;
the synergistic fusion genesis of these crucial factoids sparked our change of heart.
With a flick of the wrist and a brief utterance, we convinced our compatriots to press on, dipped out of our informal reservation at Uncle Johnny's (real name) Communal Shitwipe Shack (my addition) for the following night, and confirmed availability at the town-local Hyperoctal establishment.
The descent from heaven back to mundane purgatory was replete with scenic viewing clifftops from
which we could cast judgement on those below us.
Back on the mortal plane, our pilot furnished us with complementary ice-cold NASA Colas as we made the brief Kármán jaunt to the substation-adjacent accommodations.
We ate Italian.
Deb materialized out of the ether with a bottle of wine, and evening conversations were exchanged before we all retired.
Then you probably would expect from past experience that I wrote this composition, wouldn't you!
But no, that had to wait until after sleep, because I had not checked my email since March.
I found all kinds of very important mails in there, some reminding me that I had been alerted that I had received a message advising me that I had been elected to membership, some informing me about ticket availability for in-person events hundreds of miles away from me, and some telling me I am a bad author.
I am so glad I spent my time reading all of those!
</p>
<p>
<h2>Smoke That Smells Like Piss And Skunk Day, Civil Twilight Almost Up</h2>
Another solo night, another calm morning.
I readied my goods and slurped up my breakfast nutrients when my mom arrived with the stove.
Then we began ambulating through the forested areas.
We passed under a highway, then began walking along it towards a big howdy Welcome To Tennisy signage board, and right before reaching it the trail made a sharp 180 back towards the heart of Carolinia.
We'll get there next time.
More ambition and ambulation and we came to our meadowy view lunch sitting locale with a big old view of Big Bald (can't afford hair plugs, the poor fucker).
Then down.
Then up--by that point it was hot and umpleasant.
Then up some more.
Eventually we came to the very tippy topp of Big Bald's bald spot;
it had the grandiose three hundred and sixty (360) degree view that our customers have come to expect from a Big Brand Bald.
Mound Michelle could be sighted.
Then we went down again.
Where else is there to go when you're at the top?
We quickly came to tonight's shelter.
There was a kind gift left there in the form of a big poopy right in the middle of the best tent pad.
Papa Bear observed, "you know, that's just the kind of thing a conservative would do out here."
However, I find that the worthless drug-addled twentysomething peons who pull these kinds of stunts tend to be fairly liberal, at least to the extent that they are capable of reading the news in their social media feeds.
Perhaps we will catch the son (or daughter) of a gun and give his (or her) ass a whippin until he (or she) tells us his (or her) voting record.
If anybody has information on the whereabouts of the tent pad shitter, please contact your local militia and initiate a manhunt.

<h2>4/19 (this fraction is already simplified), Solo Dark 2: Drafting Boogaloo</h2>
I saw a barred owl last night.
I was creeping and crawling amongst the lower brambles to stash my bear-proof canister device when my red headlighter caught the silent wings of a cunning hunter as it swooped to perch on a limb.
It looked around for a minute before deciding that the vicinity was unsuitable for a rodent feast and then flew on.
But this was not to be the final owl!
In the morning, while visiting and paying homage to a small graven site, my mom and I observed another barred owl to be presiding over the restingsouls.
Fitting in-dEEd.
Dropping down a little farther down the hill, we encountered the Triple Crowner Gamer God who calls himself Link at a shelter.
As soon as my mom left to use the privulator, he asked me if I was having fun hanging out with the old slow crowd instead of people my age.
I informed him that everyone my age on the trail seems to be either stoned or drinking, so I prefer the company of people over 40.
Then my mom returned and we began to climb up the hot valley wall.
I would highly not recommend this activity to others; it was hot.
Then we reached the cambp for the night.
Or so they thought!
Jeff moved on immediately, tarjeting the next shelder.
I ate my eats and sat my sits for a while before moving on as well, tarjeting a placement just past the next shelter with a direct line of sight across the valley to the others.
I swung by Jeff's camp on the way for water and a crisp shit, and while I was there Link called me Mary Poppins in reference to my sunbrella (a pretty funny laugh joke, which is now undergoing the three day internal review before public comment in the long vetting process for all potential trappelations).
Then I strolled a teeny lil bit further up to the peak of the hill.
Light signaling between camps was attempted, and I may have seen a faint flicker, but the setting sun washed out most hope of photocommunication.
Fortunately I had excellend cellular coverage, so I was able to hold a meeting with one of my collaborators concerning recent thinkings and doings.
This lasted until Drafting Moment Time!
Time to draft the bloge!
For you readers!
Your Welcome!

<h2>Honest Aberil Waneight, Eating Another Long Meal</h2>
This morning was the most pleasant one I've had in a while.
I woke up naturally before my alarm, which is a Trail First, or Trirst, and had a calm breakfast absent company.
It took longer than I expected for the slow corps to catch back up, so I packed my things completely as I waited;
not a second after I Garmin GeoSat Messager Texted my mom, "Where the fugg are you," she appeared over the hill.
Try to summon your family members this way and let me know if you get any results.
As everyone rolled in, they showered me with food items carried from a far-away land called "town."
I ate some and stashed some for later.
We moved on through the next few miles of wooded lands, and Jeff told me highly entertaining anecdotes about the unique and superhuman maniac who fathered and raised him.
He had many great attributes, including a characteristic locution "Hey good buddy" as a warning to stop what you're doing immediately because you're doing it wrong, but the greatest detail is that he drank Pabst Blue Ribbon--a man of channeled chaos to the core.
I want to see him used as a character in a work of literature or film (Jeff assures me that he is featured in a future collection of short stories).
We passed a southy man who educated us about the state analogs of the upcoming trail (Vermont and Maine), and pressed up the rocks to emerge on the greatest section we have yet hiked.
Exposed ridgeline, allround views, several seconds of true scrambling (not the one-hand-tap stuff that sometimes gets the designation), and stiff breezes to keep us going.
The fun dumped us out right at the 300 Mile Traversal Congratulatory Rock Art, marking another 100 miles of my life sacrificed to the woods.
Just a bit more regular walking and we reached another shelter featuring the SA-SA from yesterday.
The group decided to stop here.
It was a very short day for me, which I am not thrilled about, but if I continued on my own I would be having a cold breakfast tomorrow, which absolutely cannot happen at all costs.
No No No.
So this sheltaground is my resting place for the night.
What is your resting place for the night, and is it as comfortable as it could be?
How many cumulative days of your life have you spent there?
Is it really worth that much time?
</p>
<p>
<h2>April One Seven, Solo Dark</h2>
I can't remember much from the first part of the day because I was so tired that I almost fell asleep several times while actively hiking.
The only interesting detail that made it into my long-term memory was a mild hallucination every time I blinked where the trail in front of me appeared to fall away.
I regained consciousness around when we reached a firetower and had lunch; I don't know how many miles we had gone by that point or even what time it was.
It was then that I set my big skhema ruse into motion and offered to let Ninja return to Deb's in my place and camp out on my own (this may sound generous, but I netted an extra few hours of badly needed sleep from the deal).
To everyone's surprise, he accepted, and my jubilation could be rivaled only by the swagger of a shagbark hickory under which we passed.
We rested briefly at a shelter and spoke to a Southeast Asian-Southeast American before continuing down into Allen Gap.
It took a bit to figure out the exact location of the trail crossing and get Deb's car over to it, but once we did, I extracted my extra food and epistulary goods and bid an afternoon adieu to the slackin' crew.
"Onwards," I said, "to the place I am going!"
And so I went.
The cobweps were camping a bit up the trail.
I spoke words with them at their pleasant site, but it was not far enough for me.
So I went on.
I came to another shelter and quietly contributed to its moldering operation, but it was not far enough for me.
I went on still.
At last, I crossed a small spring, filled my bigmouth squeezy bladder full, and strung up my strings between two suitable treen.
This was far enough.
All told I went 20.8 miles with 7006.2 feet of gain--my first Big Boy Hike of the trip and a personal elevation record for any hike, not just backpacking.
In the wint and colt and senting sunt, I ate a meal and desserted some goomye canedye.
Then I crawled into my sleeper.
With my head in the bag, I wrote a letter and drafted this posting.
Uh Oh!
I clamed and implied that this post was written in Solo Dark, but actually only a draft was produced at that time.
I may be straining my Time Honesty.
If you opine that the meat of the writing is in its contents, then the point of authorship was the point of drafting; however, ei he techne en toi logoi autoi estin, then only just now have I truly authored the piece.

<h2>100/10000, Too Late (there is a sertain amount of lateness i can tolerate, but gosh darn it this is just too much)</h2>
I apologize for the tired and schizophrenic nature of this entry.
I know all you eager readers are coming here for clear and cogent writing, but tonight i just canot deliver.
Haha i am joking because i do not applogize.
Comments, cuestions, and concerns may be placed into the nearest funnel spider web.
It was a good ol' day this fine day.
I woke up at a reasonable hour after some strange dreams (nothing unusual for my rapidly decaying mind) and was treated to a scruntious and nummy breakfast that probably everyone else but me helped prepare.
I am a cool rad parasite on my milieu.
Then there was some organization and filing and putting of things into their place and other tasks of relocation while my mom had an appointment with an online hiker physician expert about her ankular nociceptions and oedemas.
After that point in the day was reached, the next thing in the sequence that occurred was that we drove into Ashvill for our Big Caligulation.
I need to sit and think and really thinker it up for a while on my sits bones in proper posture before I have a insight epiphany into the nature of the town, but its poppylation is definitely representative of the New Youth.
Privileged, gentrified, artsy, "quirky," retro vintage, not like other girls, foodie, southern in aesthetics but not politics, subtly infantile, and unnecessarily queer.
We saw a lot of art, some of which was skilled but none of which was actually good or interesting, and then I ate duck at the White Duck.
(I just took a break from writing to speak to a bug.
It is smelling the table and i would gladly help it find what it's looking for if it would just tell me, but I am being given the silent treatment.
Its tiny useless brain is condemned to kinesis.
Fly away you silly fucker.)
We stopped by a waldmart for items of various kinds and shapes before heading back here.
We called my papa dad man, then i assumed control of my mom's phone and called my perennial accomplice and co-conspirator, then we ate burgers for dinner.
Then i worked on a puzzle.
Then an asslet ran around.
Then we ate ice cream and watched one of gary's adventures.
Then I worked on the puzzle more.
Then i came back here and diddled my foods and goods into my bagg.
Then I began writing this entry and using the word "then" to begin a lot of my sentences.
Haha, I just broke the fourth wall by directly referencing the text you are reading!
This is a tecnique to induce wonder, discomfort, and surprise in you, the reader, and cause you to consider explicitly the relationship between the author, the text, and the audience.
You little people don't even know what to think and neither do i.
Is this funny?
I don't think this is very funny because the only real comedy is deliberately overexplaining the fourth wall, which has probably been done by somebody before at some point.
Let me know if you think this is funny word material and i'll keep doing it because i am a pushover writing this blog (can you fucking believe that this word is so accepted that it doesn't even sound stupid to most people anymore) to gain approval from a very small intended audience of family and friends.
I have to go now because the bug is back and it has finally started speaking, it is telling me to go to sleep.
I think it may be related to fireflies based on its body shape but it is less fabulous.
"sleep little darling dont say a word momys gonna buy you a mockingbird if that mocking bird don't sing mommy's gonna hire a vocal coach"
</p>
<p>
<h2>4:15, 10/33</h2>
My mom contributed the opening line for this entry, which serves as the nucleation seed site from which a beautiful crystal lattice structure will grow: We started in the woods.
The woods were like most woods you have probably seen, except that they were the woods we were in and not the woods you were in.
We hiked through them.
After some time hiking we reached the town of Hot Springs, "Where the Springs Are Hot and the Women Are Not."
The trail path as laid out and maintained by the maintainers and layers out of the trail passes straight down the main street, which brings in enough captive Leaping Leftish Dollars to finance the operation of several higher-end restaurants and stores.
We convened at one of them along with Papa Bear's main squeeze Deb and Chef Cocoa and her main squeeze Lynn (aute kaleitai Rocky).
The food was well portioned and paired nicely with some creams iced next door.
We also performed a few near-miss flybys of the Cobweb Crew, who were in search of a new packback for Montane Crushling among other goods and services.
They secured a tempus reservatum at the Hot Springs, which we sadly failed to do, though we will be occupied tomorrow anyway with our Caligulary activities in the Ashen Villa.
We poked at the local outfitter with a stick for a few minutes, but it failed to do anything interesting, so we left Ninja to his hôtel accommodations, clowned into the Debmobile, and vroom vroomed out into the glowing countryside.
Deb's house is incredible.
Beaucolic, idyllic, idiosyncratic, oeconomic, and subtly mischevious are just some of the many ways one might describe this grand slam of magna opera.
Its foundation is built from hefty, robust strokes of creative genius, atop which countless gentle and thoughtful details have been laid through many years of joyful habitation.
Even the RV-AirBnB-to-be we are sleeping in is a work of art.
A relaxing afternoon visited by a baby ass and some calves gave way to a pleasantly cool evening of grilled salmon, roasted asparagus, fresh salad, and killer macaroni caseusque.
Two things pushed the day over the threshold from great to superb: the letter which was so terriffically mishandled by Fontana Dan finally made its way into my posession, and a friendly geriatric dog shat on the floor right as a story was being told about it shitting on the floor.
I had not realized canines could develop a sense of comedic timing if left to age.
Go figure.
</p>
<p>
<h2>April Fourteener, One Month On Trail! Congratulations! as the Damp Drizzle Darkens While I Lie Under My Rain Fly</h2>
As usual, we were the last two packfolk to leave camp this morning.
Often this is a mild nuisance, but today it allowed us to summit Maximum Patchwork at just the right time for an expansive and weather-filled view.
The coming reign could be seen passing over the lower smokles.
My mother has gradually been accepting the trail appelation, or trappelation, "Navigator" over the past few days (given not because she is uncommonly good at navigating or the only one who navigates but because neither of the sixty-somethings in the group bother to try and I'm not the one who tells them what to do);
with perfectly ironic timing, we became about three minutes lost on our way down thence when we missed a turnblaze.
Once we wrighted our rong, we encountered a string of rootchucks, dirtslingers, and chainsaw berserkers cuttin' and puttin' the footpath ahead.
There was a lot of flowers.
Shortly thereafter our second-shelter lunch rendezvous took place amid drizzle and looming thunder, and I had the pleasure of using a small, crooked privy that made for great sport pissing.
Our compatriots remained near us for the rest of the day.
The rain got us good on the descent to camp, and Mr. God even threw in some sunshowers and a salamander for his and our entertainment.
Since arriving and assembling and hanging, nobody has left their assembly or hang on account of the water.
The thunder has cowered away from us so far.
Perhaps it will man up tonight.
Since my mom's succumption to the trail insanity, or trinsanity, of the trail name, or trame, convention, I have been pondering what my trail fate, or trate, will be.
I've decided that there are only two names I would ever accept: Slow, or preferably Dimwit.
Getting somebody to name me one of these will be my next challenge.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/13, Oh No It's Thursday The Thirteenth! Early Bed After A Long Day</h2>
Our host prepared a veritable smorgasboard of healthy breakfast options for us this morning.
While we enjoyed them, Jephf relayed a story he heard from a shuttle driver about a young(?) woman picked up from Clingman's Dome while having a meltdown;
apparently she intended to quit and was so hysterical that she tried to grab the wrong pack as she left.
We all hope and suspect that it was our Hiking Associate.
An STS mission, a roadwalk, and a short hike later, we passed the HippieZone and began our big day's climb.
It wasn't long before we caught up with our friendly acquaintanceperson who calls himself Ninja and persuaded him to join our mountain troupe, bringing our total ranks to five (probably enough to overthrow a small vassal state).
Up, up, up Alice fell.
It was hot, which I did not like, but it got a little bit cooler as we returned to a more acceptable altitude, which I did like.
We took our lunch basking in the ambient radiation from an FAA radar tower.
To show my appreciation for the federal government and its many agencies, I left a generous donation just inside the fence enclosing it.
Then more hiking.
And some more after that.
And a little bit more at the end.
All told, we scooted a record 13.9 miles with 0.99 miles of gain.
My legs feel leggy, as though they were composed of bone, sinew, and muscle wrapped in skin.
We pitched camp just down the hill from a lovely RV couple who offered us drinks, conversation, and a place to hide our food for the night--I see a letter from Hogwarts in their future.
Tomorrow may be wet, which sometimes happens.
I am told it has to do with the water cycle.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/12 = 1/3, look at all that divisibility! A Discerning Evening After the Crew has Fallen Asleep</h2>
Not long after I finished composing my missive yestereve, as I lay in my hanging quarters, a Bard Owl began to call into the night.
This is not an infrequent occurrence out here in the bush and tangle.
But seldom is it accompanied by what followed: mistaking the owl for a very strange sounding human, Papa Bear shouted out from his tent, "come on man, grow up!"
This was later classified by the NSA as a Minor Camp Disturbance requiring no tactical intervention.
Trail Karma got the best of him when at roughly circa 4:30 in the wee morning a band of daysleeping hooligans rolled into the shelter grounds and woke everyone up; their rowdy, obnoxious, vaguely creepy, and probably drug-fueled behavior continued in the morning after Papa Bear retaliated by waking them up with his pots and pans.
We managed to escape without being harassed or diddled thanks to Jeffica's PR experience and smooth wit.
Down the trail we strolled briskly, propelled by talk of childhood fist fights.
A 1.2 mile extended day choice option traversed us over to Mount Camembert, which boasts an octagonal firetower with a splendid octagonal view.
The dank remains of a latrine can be found in its basement amongst other refuse and debris.
A bit more dreary descent and we reached the famed prison shelter, at which we had arranged to eat lunch.
I dined behind bars.
The farther down we went the more deciduous and disgusting the woods became, until we exited the Great Smoky Mountains and reached a truly abominable power line cut-in baked by unrelenting sun.
I have composed some Delta Verse to convey the vibrational mood, which I call the High Altitude Blues.
Please enjoy: "The wind is hot; the sun is dry; I hear automobiles going by--I'm walking down, and I want to turn around.
The number of day hikers grows as you drop in altitude.
Gnats over here, poison ivy there, warm domestic animal shit everywhere;
fuck the lowlands and flies and midges, I prefer the no man's state border ridges.
Now I have to climb back up to a higher altitude."
The last segment of the day redeemed itself slightly by routing us through an immaculately floral riparian area complete with falls and creek crossings.
We were met at a bridge by our magical and extremely discerning host (hilarious moment when he brought up his conservative politics and everyone else in the car shut up), who piloted us expertly through the Standing Bear Shroomfest Hippie Crisis Commune to extract an important payload and then to our hôtel accommodations.
That's right, those still exist here.
I bet you mentally impaired readers forgot all about my stupid hôtel gags.
This hôtel is by far the most discerning of all the hôtels on the trail.
Only discerning hikers are allowed to stay here.
We performed the usual accommodations dance, donned extra large loaner clothing, and headed back into the NASA rental for a mexican dinner and Premium Walton Experience (we got extra lucky at this one because Once in a Lifetime came on the radio while we were looking for painkillers).
On the way back from town our host-pilot delighted and surprised me by putting on Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers.
I didn't think he could get any better, but later in the night, while we performed some Trail Calculus, or Tralculus, he came in to inform us about a recent Trail Assault, or Trassault, with a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon in his hand.
He has everything I strive for.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/11, Just 5 More Months to 9/11! Awaiting an Evening Call</h2>
A schordt day today, which permitted us a glorious late start.
We ate small foods at various places; one was Ye Olde Helipad, where we encountered The Last of the Slobos, who calls himself No Rush.
He warned us that we were about to enter the section of forest where remains of one of the Air Force's great 450-mile-per-hour fuckups are strewn over 20 acres of mountainside--a teriffically mangled piece of aircraft lay right next to the trail, warning passersby of the dangers of working for the government.
The day's prime lunch locale consisted of a small but ample junction rock where a witful young lady who calls herself Turkey Legs was enjoying her smoke break (in a refreshing and based twist, she was smoking tobacco, not ganja).
We discussed the merits of bluegrass between puffs and bites.
My mom and Gary Beary had both been hobbling on mildy injured feet all day, and by this time I was itching and scratching to boost into another reference frame, so I popped out in front and half-speedwalked, half-jogged the rest of the way to the shelter.
As the evening progressed and Jeffemy rolled in, we found ourselves sat next to each other in a row on a fallen treetrunk like the ants on a log that we are.
Joined by another lil' hikin' trio confederation, we all reveled as Jeph employed his masculine aim to work around a leak in his filter bladder.
What a splendid endid to a Near Nero!
</p>
<p>
<h2>41/0 (do dyslexic people ever mess up punctuation like this? no? sounds like a fake condition to me), Chilly Digit Hour</h2>
Despite our longest milage yet, supple trails and mild clines made today a breezy wind.
Two deers and a Hermite thrush graced us early in the morningtime.
We visited Charles' Foot Deformity, where I engaged in some painterly reenactment, and traversed miles of an entertainingly narrow ridge marking the exact Carolinia-Tennisy governance riftline.
Views into the vallies of both formerly self-governing nations abounded.
At one point we came across a perplexing 200 mile marker constructed from sticks at precisely the 219.85 mile mark--no, I know what you're thinking you silly bean, it can't be from a previous year when the milage was different because the sticks wouldn't even have survived a heavy rain.
The source of the error remains mysterious.
Arriving at last at our shelter's vicus, we found it to be unexpectedly teeming with fellow homines; I estimate and reckon that extrapolating from my approximate count there ought to be easily 40 of us in and around the structure.
We managed to secure a plot with suitable trees down here in the urbs, but other less fortunate latecomers were forced to settle for a night up in the suburbs.
My dinner was long, as it always is when a Top Ramen flavor packet is involved.
Now I am resting in the Red Dark.
Looking back over this day and recollecting it in sum on the whole, I would have to conclude that the highlight was hearing a small old lady with a quintessential frail elderly voice say, "would anybody like to smoke some marijuana?"
The people out here are <em>fried</em>.
</p>
<p>
<h2>2squared 3squared, Harvesting Warmth from the Last Hour of Helios</h2>
Sunrise Success!
Our morning vista from Mr. Cling's Concrete Cylinder was the perfect remedy for that fateful foggy day two and a half years ago.
The wind and cold made it a little tricky to cook breakfast up there, but we managed anyway and received some magical gifting comestibles in the process.
Then it was back down the ramp to the trail turnoff.
At last we crossed the true 200 mile measurement delineation point and the global trail altitude maximum apex (no hubub or marked indication at either, just the way I like it).
The rest of the day was a bit touristy but nonetheless pleasant.
We encountered more trail magicians in a parking lot that was a bit of a zoo, you're right, it's true.
Many of the daywalkers and foreign nationals peppering the trails gave us funny looks, but at least one Little Miss Maintainer inferred and approved of our pilgrimage.
The sheltacrew tonight is a light and laid back mix of familiar and unfamiliar faces; Pop Ber and Jef are among them.
Our hammocks are swingin' on a splendid overlook.
With luck we'll have another good oriental view tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Eighpril Ateth, Lights Out for Jesus</h2>
Donuts woke me this morning.
Before I had a chance to say, "mmmm, that's a yummy donut," we were out the door and on our way to Scruby Tuby Warsh House (I didn't make this up either).
I would rate it a perfect 5/7: it's creatively decorated, charges reasonable rates, displays impressively well-kempt houseplants, and is run by Wayne, who has a long white beard almost as thick as his accent and tells some real knee-slappers.
Our pleasantly short wait was made to feel even shorter by the comically propagandistic agitation-entertainment called CBS news playing on the little TV box in the sitting area.
When the clothes came out dry, we zipped down the strip to an IHOP and enjoyed a very traditional and culturally appropriate breakfast meal.
Our Afternoon Excitement neared ever closer.
We popped into a very tourist-oriented outfitter (about at the plush toy level, just below selling you green screen pictures of yourself), then to a Walton Market, and then back to the motel to get ready, get set, and go cross the road.
What lay there?
Chickens, of course, but not just any ol' cocks and hens.
These domestic fowl belonged to the Hatfields and McCoys, and they were about to have a Dinner Feud (2:00 pm showing).
We filtered in through an elaborate plastic Disneylike trinketmonger's quarters and took our seats on the Hatfield's turf.
Food was served and consumed; I could sense and appreciate the immense efforts of the chefs to make it perfectly unobjectionable and universally palatable (no easy task).
As we chewed and waited for the action, a young female cast member whom my mom aptly but confusingly described as "perky" came to recruit us for an Audience Participation Gag near the end of the show.
What luck!
This had a 3% chance of happening.
Then out came the Mayor to introduce the banjo band to introduce the feud.
I cannot properly describe what transpired over the next hour and a half in any reasonable number of words, so I won't try.
Our fifteen seconds of fame involved probing and threading a utensil beneath our garments--we lost, mostly thanks to the dimwit next to me who stood on the line and held up the slack.
He must be college educated.
Suffice it to say that I will be puzzling deeply over the implications of this experience for years to come.
Once Party Time was over, we retired to our rooms and performed various organizational tasks and duties until stopping.
I should sleep now; in several hours we will race the sun up a mountain, and I'm gonna need all the energy I can get.

<h2>Aperil Sevength, Late Late Time for Bed</h2>
The Clingman Clime was, like most things out here in the backcountry wilderwoods, not as difficult as anticipated.
For the first few miles we hiked through a thunderstorm, which I had not done before and enjoyed greatly.
Then the rain lifted for a time and afforded us some views of the smoky (also known as fogness or cloud material) that the mountains are named for.
We stopped at a shelter with a fire just as driplets began to fall once more, and an hour or so later stopped at another shelter without a fire but with a uniquely bizzarre privy sporting wheelchair instructions
(just across the border into Carolinia of course, but I guess even they have some aggressive ADA lobbyists to contend with).
At this point the forest abruptly became coniferous and began to resemble Cascadia.
The rain made the trees and moss glisten until the clouds miraculously lifted again to reveal one of the most spectacular views I have seen in my life.
As we climbed higher, the view got better.
It could have been a perfect hike, but my mother insisted that we divert from the trail early to reach the summit a few minutes quicker, leaving both the highest point on the whole trail and the 200 mile mark for Sunday.
We passed a false 200 mile sign made of sticks (whoever put it there is an idiot, it's literally on a paved road instead of the trail), and just as we climbed the curvaceous concrete interpretive observational structure ramp the fog blew in and blocked the view.
We began walking down the pavement to the parking lot; within 5 minutes the view was back.
If we had gone my way we would have had the high point, 200 miles, and an incredible 360-degree unobstructed view to end the day.
Sometimes people make bad decisions, and we have to remember that they are only human, and most humans have remarkably feeble minds.
Reaching the tourist- and syllabary-filled parking lot, we were greeted by Papa Bear and Mama Bear, who drove us down the mountain and straight into the next phase of my grandplan scheme: Operation Pigeonhole.
I've been laying the groundwork for this since we decided to hike the trail, and it all came to fruition as we drove down that potently cursed road into the frenetic, cartoonish vacation mecca the people call Pigeon Forge.
We are tourist tourists: not only here to see the garish attractions, but to study the tourism generated by them.
An early dinner at Shoney's gave us time to book accommodations, and--without my input--my mother fell for one of the classic blunders, selecting a delighfully seedy cheap motel based on its appealing name.
It is across the street from an upside-down building.
This was a stretch goal for me, so I am over the moon that we managed to achieve such cultural immersion.
After some showers, Papa Bear suggested we go out for icy cream--no complaints from me.
Back down the main strip we drove in our "pajamas" (laundry is a morning problem) to a bustling joint operated by the friendly local Moldovan immigrants; creams were consumed and fudges were purchased.
With the smile of a kid in a candy store, Papa Bear declared that he needed a half-gallon of chocolate milk.
In its customary way, Publix swooped in from across the street to satisfy his desire and afford us an opportunity to replenish our provisions.
I can now say I have purchased granola bars from the Publix in Pigeon Forge at night while wearing skin-tight patterned thermal leggings.
It is quite late, but there is no need to fret, for we have elected to take a Caligula (appropriate given the decadent insanity) tomorrow.
It ought to be a wild time, but it won't be able to beat this incredible very good excellent day, which I am officially deeming 99% perfect.
</p>
<p>
<h2>April Sixthstsths, Waitin' for Dinner to Soak</h2>
The intermittent drizzle began when God and I peed simultaneously this morning.
Over the following few hours He moistened everything and everyone with His gentle spray;
this set the scene for a dreamy, wonderful, madgical day.
We legged ourselves through fairyland forests (the fairies are midges, flies, and gnats), dense laurel thickets, and gentle mountaintop meadows with rocky spots and scenic viewing overlook sights.
After dipping back into Carolinia for a brief privy session we began hiking in the company of Snuggie.
We zenithed Rockletop, from which Mound Springus could be picked out amongst the ridges and peaks, and then traversed to Aunt Jemima's Bisquick Thunderdome.
On the final stretch of the day I managed to spot one of the Ruffled Grousers we have been hearing for about 100 miles:
alerted by the rustling of leaves in time with its usual wing drums, I scrambled up a small mound and spent a good minute staring straight at it before I realized it was perched pensively on a log.
The shelter situation tonight is nearly the same as the last.
A big sloppy meal is in order, for tomorrow we tackle the Dome, rain or shine.
Mr. Clingman ain't even gonna know what even hit him!
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/5 Stars (Pretty Good But I Have Some Constructive Criticism), After Dinner After The Previous Post</h2>
Have you heard of stream of consciousness writing?
Pleasant breakfast, still no letter.
We have done our best to forward it.
The shuttle pilot was different today, slightly more competent, but they still didn't understand that when you have multiple destinations you need to load the trunk in reverse order.
Tetris Prank Gone Wrong (Gone Sexual) Police Were Called!
Got back to Fontana Dan eventually.
If anybody has been searching for the whereabouts of the literal gates of hell, we found them there.
It was very hot by the time we started walking.
Crossing Dan was not too bad, nor was the pavement up to the permit box (thank you retiree for telling us where it was in excruciating detail), but as soon as we started climbing I was toast.
Too hot for coal.
I was literally dripping sweat--I cannot remember the last time that happened.
Big beads of sweat rolled down my shining brow as I exerted myself.
I was a sticky wet boy.
A few snakes stopped by to laugh at me (not our first, that was yesterday, forgot to mention it, OOPS HAHA!).
At last we gained the ridgeline, as the mountaineers say, and a stiff Tennisy breeze blew away the North Carolinia heat and hot.
Up shucklestack we went, then up the most sy-gogglin firetower I've climbed in all my days for a nice windy birdeye view of the surrounding mountains and hills and orogenic sceneries.
Down and up again brought us to the fawn fairyland of Yggdrasil, which was pretty cool.
Worth climbing in April.
Not much to speak of until the shelter, which is of stone construction and would be the nicest one we've stayed near if not for the multitude of inconveniences caused by being in Tennisy.
Awful bureacratic stuff.
There are signs saying to boil all the water here.
Leftover signage from the '70s?
Legitimate warning?
Nobody knows.
There are a few mentions that we need to somehow hang our bear canisters--the whole point of those is you don't hang them.
But we must comply, so up go our backpacks to hang in the overnight rain.
And there are no privies at these shelters.
Why?
The really flamboyant one, who calls himself Flowers, very probably has the answer: in Tennisy they would have to be (drumroll) ADA accessible.
Genuine Brazil-tier insanity.
So now we are camping just uphill of the shelter's designated shitfield.
Time's up, mommy wants her phone back.
Goodnight online person!
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/4 = 1 ALERT WE HAVE REACHED UNITY, Late Day After a Dumpster Stay</h2>
To our relief, the Turbo-Preschoolers quieted down a little while after I finished writing.
An hour or so later a large pack of coyotes began to howl at the waxing moon--very exciting very cool!
Novelty item in the woods!
(While writing this I was visited by a small bee; I fear he may have misunderstood and thought that the novelty item was on the phonescreen. I greeted him, but he quickly flew away when he ascertained the quality of my prose.)
In a handful of locutionary beats that are still beyond my understanding, the howling initiated a loud Turbo-Conversation about Florida and the housing market.
Eventually my mother activated her maternal discipline and instructed the offenders to "please continue the conversation in the morning."
Sleep soon followed.
The following day started out muggy and buggy with enough haze to wash out our views, but the mood flipped when we descended through an impressively lush slope full of many plant leaves and petals.
Our progress was slowed by at least five individual varieties of trilium among other flora.
Reaching water level, we passed the Fontana Marinara, trotted lakeside to the Fontana Hilton (where I peed in the toilet for more novelty), and roadwalked down to meet Fontana Dan himself.
He is a big ugly concrete structure.
As we understood things, we were to enter the visitors center, which was Built For The People Of The United States, and phone for a shuttle to our accomodational area.
We walked in and asked the retiree at the desk if we could phone for a shuttle.
She said, "yes," then walked us over to the display and began her very gradual lecture on the construction of the Dan.
Father Beowulf wisely slipped out around this time.
After several minutes of useless information about factories that make and roll out aluminum into sheets, do you know what those are called?
Well anyway those kinds of factories, we quietly walked over to ask the other retiree at the desk if we could phone for a shuttle.
He said, "yes," and handed us a phone.
We waited; he spoke at us slowly about the precise layout of the hiking permit box.
The shuttle landed nominally (no damaged foam tiles on this mission--it's always a crapshoot with the management at NASA).
We boarded with tired haste, but our efficiency turned out to be in vain: the pilot went inside and willingly conducted an entire conversation with the retirees about a nearby electric car charger.
When he damn well pleased, he got back into the vehicle, turned on the Grateful Dead, and began flying a circuitous and highly suboptimal route to our destination.
On the way we found Jeffy again.
Landing at the Prime 1970s Dancing Vacation Destination, we picked up our self-care packages, showered immediately, and dressed up in our finest rainy day suits to go walk to the laundromat.
Why walk when it's hot and sunny and we're wearing waterproof clothing?
Well, we tried to phone for the shuttle again, but after waiting over 20 minutes we figured the pilot had found more retirees to discuss car chargers with and took a stroll.
We sat and watched the washers tumble with some other washer watchers;
ice cream would have been next door, but Due to lack of Employees the Ice Cream Shop will not open this season We are sorry for this inconvenience!!
A nearby extortionist gas station satiated my creamlust, and a maintainence magician rolled in shortly after to toss us some Girl Scout Pyramid Scheme Biscuits.
But it was too late--my headache had already begun.
Out came the clothes and up we went to the resturant.
We ate your typical very large meal of large foods for large people; even this failed to quell the headache.
Back up to the lodge, where we learned that general postal incompetence would prevent me from receiving a letter I had been anticipating for over a week.
The headache worsened.
Back to our room for calls, organization, hiker trades, rapid cleaning of pots, using tiny cups to fill our bottles with the worst tap water I have ever tasted, packing.
Too much.
Most of our planned activities would have to wait for yet another town day.
By this point I was in quite some pain and deleriously tired, so I dropped everything and just went to bed while Trail Mom (our Hiking Associate is frighteningly close behind us according to Jiff) attempted to mail a package back home.
I didn't even get to write the bloging post!
Can you believe that reader!
I apologize deeply and profoundly for my severe and continuous lapse of judgement.
Please don't punish me for the delay.
I cannot take any more whippings, beatings, or assaults on my person.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/3 Is An Improper Fraction So You Need To Split It Into Integral And Fractional Parts, Bedtime Before Sunset</h2>
Do not be misled by the whining and complaining of others at our campsite: today was an easy and pleasant hike.
We saw mildly interesting flowers, mildly interesting rocks, and other mildly interesting things that
"MIKE HOWS THE QUILT"
you might see in the woods.
There was a spat of sprinkled drizzle around midday,
"I WAS GETTIN SO MAD AT YOU ALBERT"
but
"I ALMOST HAD TO SWING MY BEAR LINE OVER A TREE AND GO AROUND THE OTHER SIDE"
even that could not break the mildly interesting streak.
"I WAS WAITIN FOR YOU GUYS TO CATCH UP WITH ME"
We waited out out the worst of it while eating lunch in
"A LITTLE ERIC CLAPTON BLUES *loud music*"
a peculiar shelter with a gap in the
"MIKE HOWS THAT QUILT DOIN"
floor.
The rest of the day was smooth sailing, as the sailors say.
Rolling into camp, we were pleased to see a Pencilvania man we have been encountering who calls himself Chex Mix, and while we ate dinner Snuggie joined the party.
Our jubilational good vibe zone was sudddenly
"HOW YOU DOIN SUZIE, WARMIN UP?"
broken, however, when we realized that
"OKAY I THINK IM GETTIN INTO BED NOW"
the shelter's vicinity was populated by the same disgraceful people who wouldn't shut up last night.
The youth crowd spent an infuriatingly long time engaged in loud conversation right by our hammocks (not anywhere near their tents), but the worst offenders tonight are actually some middle- to old-aged siblings.
They're all in their tents and hammocks already, but every few minutes one of them shouts to the others and interrupts my train of thought.
I have no idea what makes them think this is acceptable behavior.
If I hear one more outburst from them I will send them back to Turbo-Preschool, which is a lot like regular preschool (teaching the alphabet, basic manners, which Eric Clapton songs are good and which ones are bad) except instead of being punished with a time out I come piss on your tent.
"TO THINK TOM AND ALBERT YOU GET TO SEE YOUR WIVES TOMORROW"
Looks like the tent pisser will strike for the first time this evening.
</p>
<p>
<h2>April 2: "We Doin' April Again", Calm Early Evening Punctuated by Twenty-Somethings Making Normie-Tier OnlyFans Jokes Three Years After They Stopped Being Funny (Hahahahahahahahaa)</h2>
As the suns rise and fall, we creep ever closer to the limits of what I have done.
Today we surpassed the 4000 foot ascent mark for the first time on this trip.
My personal record is over a mile, so I'm not breaking barriers and exploring new horizons of progress and change yet, but this is still respectable.
The climb did not present us with any substantive difficulty.
Still, my knees were not quite entirely satisfied to their utmost and greatest comfort during our meager descent.
Jeffuel decided to stop short and rest up his blistering toeskin, but BearDad is keeping a common schedule with us.
Our campsite was promisingly sparse when we arrived in the afternoon and began to hang our hanging items, but over the next several hours a steady stream of mostly youthful arrivals tiled the narrow gap floor with their tenting arrangements.
Only then did it occur to me how little difference there is between AT campsites and homeless encampments; they definitely have comparable rates of drug posession and use.
Maybe the police will arrive and use their nightsticks to gently remind the youth that others are trying to sleep.
If not, I am equipped with bear spray.
</p>
<p>
<h2>APRIL FOOL! HAHA YOU GO T FOOLED! YOU ARE A GULIBLE PERSON! at Past My Bedtime</h2>
We have had a few Nerones already, but today was the first of our unscheduled Caligulae.
The wind forecast worsened overnight to include gusts of over one mile per minute, and with the added water weight from last night's torrent on the limbes and branjes, the mob psyche concluded that hiking out was not a safe option (you will find that the mob psyche is very safety cautious).
A group rationalization followed the decision.
My mother, Papi Oso, our host, and a woman who calls herself Brightside elaborated at some length that this was definitely the right choice, that we were putting safety first and being responsible even if it meant not making progress, and that when hiking the AT&T it's better to avoid injury than push it too far--they were surprisingly full of trail wisdom for never having done this before.
I resigned to the will of the crowd and began killing time by carving.
A woman staying here mounted an expedition to the grocer and provided sandwich fixings and donuts pro bono, which ate another hour or so.
At one point the forest janny came over to check out my stick.
After some conversation we discovered a Big Boy coincidence: he and his brother and me and my brother independently invented the term Big Boy Hike to refer to any hike longer than 20 miles with more than a mile of gain.
He then gifted me a knife, which adds him to the list of people who have gifted me knives.
Not much else happened.
If all goes as planned, we will be on the move again tomorrow, where I am excited to see what may be a truly hellish level of wind damage and trailcrossing treefalls.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Final Day of the Great Month of Marching, Dimly Trombone-lit Nighttime</h2>
Today's allotment of soil was not as deadly dull as yesterday's.
Though others cowered, we found the deep drops, scrams, and screes more amusing than foreboding;
the rest of the trail was graded just shallow enough to be uninteresting and just steep enough to be hard on the knees.
Arriving at the riparian tourist buffer, we exfiltrated our prearranged postal parcel and consumed an ample mid-day-eat before boarding the spacecraft bound for our booked beds.
The place we are staying is very progressive--it deconstructs the hotel-hôtel binary by branding itself a "boutique glamping resort."
It consists of several aggressively themed tiny houses: the Reel-It-Inn, the Red Woof Inn, some kind of yurt, a hairy poder themed one, the Chicken Coop, and a literal schoolbus are among them, but ours is New Orleans Style.
We have old brass wind wallhangers, Louis Armstrong portraits, fleurs-de-lis, and mardi gras paraphernalia.
The whole establishment would be tacky if it weren't so unreasonably well done.
The woman responsible for it all is a genuine hoot and sharp as a whipcrack.
She worked in advertising before typesetting and illustration were digitized, and the meticulous attention to motes of detail cultivated in that field has carried over to her present occupation.
One of the youthful lads she employs also works as a Forest Service janny;
we heard him warn some slackers about naughty homicidal trees at a tentsite down the road, so we decided to consult him on our plan to camp tomorrow in 50 mile-per-hour winds.
When we explained that we were in hammocks, a crazed flash illuminated his face and caused his eyes to widen.
"Oh. OH. I hadn't thought of that... man, that's a hot idea!"
We may be seeing him at camp tomorrow.
I've just enjoyed a little oreo ice cream cup as a late night snack, and once I brush my teeth I'll be gettin in bed with a full tummy.
Full tummy bedtimes are my favorite bedtimes because I am a fat fucking glutton.
Join me on my quest for meaning in this nightmare world of soul-harvesting consumption: eat sweet treats and sleep.
</p>
<p>
<h2>3/30 (A Nice Round Number As You Can See), Dust Time</h2>
A late start this morning began a completely uneventful day of hiking.
Nothing of note happened.
The second half of our route was somewhat dead, dusty, and unpleasant;
even climbing a fire tower with a clear view of the smokies was a dry experience.
Camp is run-of-the-mill and lightly populated.
We interacted briefly at dinner with a colorfully dressed man whom Wendy referred to as "the really flamboyant one"--an apt moniker, considering he speaks only in his falsetto range.
I can tell he doesn't just have a high voice both by his strained timbre and because whenever he laughs, makes involuntary vocalizations, or imitates a man, he uses his underlying modal voice, which is alarmingly deep for his affected persona.
Strange people out here in appalachialand.
Tomorrow we descend for six miles straight into the KNOCK--KNantahala Outdoor CenterK--which may be unpleasant on the knees and feets and other parts of the leg device.
If the terrain is as dusty as today I will begin slaying fellow hikers so that their blood wets the earth.
And another addendum: yesterday there was a strange basement alcove in the firetower on the second bald.
Inside it wasa single empty can of Pabst Blue Ribbon.
Have the beerlads been here?
</p>
<p>
<h2>329 4216 5225 6236, The Morning After Because It Was Too Damn Cold</h2>
As we gathered our gatherings and assembled our assemblies in preparation for departing the motel, something remarkable happened:
Mark Zuckleman personally delivered us a notice that the government was setting the trail on fire.
This little monkey of a development threw a wrench in our plans to start the big day early.
Jefferald decided to spend another day in town and dip his heel in the stygian waters, while we, Ursus Pater, and Ursa Mater awaited the all-clear go-ahead at a waffle dealer sans waffles.
The meal was full of kindred spirit.
Lacking a status update after billing up, we trucked on into the gap to hobnob with the government arsonists and stooges in hopes of extracting their incendiary intelligence.
They had none.
We sat around for a few hours until the pyropter finally swung by and the ridge began to smoke.
Then, with our Forest Service Detainment over, we began hiking around 3 pm.
An initial climb took us straight through the path of the flames--abundant smoke to inhale, ashen forest floor, burning leaf litter, flaming snags, and even a dud firebomb were among the scenery of the obliquely lit afternoon.
Eventually we reached a bald and climbed to the top through flaming meadows.
I endowed my walking stick with a char feature as we took in the unobstructed 2pi radian view.
A runner's high carried me to the next bald, where we climbed a fire tower and saw the reddest setting sun of my life before descending into camp--a record pace for our trip.
The shelter was unexpectedly packed.
We set up and ate in dark red silence before climbing beneath our quilts.
Despite the freezing temperature, we were warm.
</p>
<p>
<h2>328 4216 5232 6264, Not Sure Exactly What Time It Is (Solar Wise, I Am Typing On A Smardphone With A Clock) Because Of The Blinds</h2>
Beggels, yoghurt, creen cheen, garnola, mufflins, granberries, coughee--it was a bekfast of chanpioms.
The hôtel hôts were reserved, yet jovial; calm, yet exuberantly kind.
Fueled and cooled, we made our merry way to the launchpad which costs millions of dollars of taxpayer money, think about that seriously for a moment, and Blasted Off! back to the head of the trail.
Step up, step down.
Step all around!
Step step step.
Coming down the steps we stepped right up to our familymember, who calls herself Chef Cocoa.
She flew us to the resupply, to the motel, to a tasty long lunch, and back to the motel, dishing out tips, wisdom, and gear bits the whole time.
It was a wonderful and generous reunion.
Papa Bear and Jersey Jeff are at the same motel, so we all rounded ourselves up into a round with Papa Bear's Lady Friend in accompaniment and sauntered over to the local latin watering hole to meet some fellow walkers and talkers.
I ate food; others wasted away.
Under unexpectedly smokey skies we now retire in our hopefully bedbugless arrangements.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Marge Twendy Semen, Chica and Well Past Sunsets</h2>
The thunderstorms in the forecast unfortunately missed us;
we heard some thunder and saw some lightning, but the meat and potatoes of the real action skirted just to our south.
I was hoping for more hammock-swingin' wind.
My consolation prize was climbing up some fun rock embellishments in the trail to the 100 mile fire tower, marking 100 miles in this 100 mile journey.
I feel so moved, it's almost like I've moved 100 miles.
What an emotional moment for me.
I am a very emotional woman.
In the early afternoon we were picked up by our Exclusive NASACAR Driver and flown by space to the Exclusive Hôtel for Exclusive People.
By coincidence, the only other Exclusive Person staying here is Wendy from Freedom Day.
After cleaning our beans we docked to the ISS and went out on the small town.
We dined at a USDA Forest Service Certified Free-Range Organic Soil Conservation No-Till Permaculture Local GMO-Free Wellness Animal Health Wholesome Farm-to-Table establishment.
I ate a bird, and my mom ate a fish.
FroYo Bro (No Mo' Po' Ho's) stood in for a proper ice creem desert.
We ran into a few highkers on the lil main street of this cute lil village whose economy is completely dependent on AT tourism, making the livelihood of most people here fundamentally at risk, and signed their cute lil AT banner. Now we are going to bed.
My mom is snoring.
Will I be able to fall asleep?
Find out on the next episode of Turn Off The Goddamn Screen You Lazy Piece Of Shit And Go Do Something Productive.

<h2>Marchie 2*13, End of a Hard Day's Workin' Hikin' Excursion'</h2>
A brief, light rain woke us this morning.
We took one last view from the summit, complete with about 10 degrees of a rainbow, and then made a slow ridgewise descent.
At several points we caught sight of the fire tower at the 100 Mile Markerino Award Center, which we will be passing tomorrow if tonight's thunderstorms don't kill us.
Lunch was taken at a run-down shelter where a prophecy inscribed on the walls warned us of KGB AI Demon Tech Mind Control.
A mangled bear canister was left there as a warning; fāma fert that a bear successfully broke into it a few nights ago.
We then passed through a very strange section of woods which hinted at some catastrophic event several years in the past--vast stretches of dead understory with only short living plants, an impressive number of wide treefalls, and generally unusual soil.
Eventually it gave way to regular forest, and eventually the regular forest gave way to non-bear-sanctuary regular forest.
Camping with us tonight are Jersey Jeff and Papa Bear, the two most pleasant people we have met who are still on trail, or entraille if you will.
Entraille is spelled as though it were a French word, and would therefore be pronounced similarly to the English phrase "on trail," making this a pun.
And one addend to last night's report: I somehow forgot to mention the crucial fact that the beerlads were drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon.
This beer choice foreshadowed the havoc they wrought when they returned to the shelter at the base of the mountain.
</p>
<p>
<h2>March 25th, A New Holiday Called "Freedom Day," 5450 Feet in the Evening</h2>
BIG day. Big League. Bam. BINGO!
The thunderstorm last night was ferocious and thrilling.
If you have never hammocked in a thunderstorm with 40-mile-per-hour winds, I <em>highly</em> recommend it.
You <em>have</em> to try it.
We got a late start in the morning, partly due to the storm, but mostly due to some amazing fantacular news:
through the divine power of elaborate roundabout nepotism, we have been gifted a stay at the most exclusive hôtel on the whole Ablation Trail.
Only exclusive people are allowed to stay there.
We will also have a personal NASA-approved shuttle pilot for our day in town.
After sorting and delivering our thanks to the requisite parties, we set out on our climb.
On the slopes of a mountain, we discovered that we are now within eyeball distance of the Smoking Hills.
Clingman's Dome (real name, I did not make this up) can be faintly made out among the distant ridges.
The mid-after-noon-time brought us to a TrailMagical operation of truly industrial scale.
Paralyzed by the unexpected multitude of choices, I settled on two samoas, a bag of cheez-its, and some Welch's fruit snacks.
A walk up the hill brought us to a very windy shelter inhabited by Wendy and some strange creatures disguized as twentysomethings.
Wendy encouraged us to follow our fears and stay put, but we duly ignored her, and upon the reappearance of our Hiking Associate and Jersey Jeff we resolved to camp atop Standing Indian Mountain.
This was to be a fateful decision.
The walk was relatively easy, and the campsite turned out to be superb, but despite this good fortune, our Hiking Associate began unraveling.
In a manner eerily similar to that of my ex-girlfriend, she threw the most juvenile temper tantrum I have witnessed in several years, deciding quicker than the fickle wind that me, Jersey Jeff, and my mom--whom she has been calling her "trail mom" since day one--are all "assholes."
According to her, this was because we didn't want to cook directly in our campsites in bear territory.
In reality, we suspect she has a touch of some personality disorder, decided a few days ago that she did not want to continue on the trail, and has constructed an internal fantasy to blame her failure on others.
She decided to go back down the mountain to the shelter; she ostensibly intends to leave the trail tomorrow.
I hope she does.
My mom and Jeff tried to convince her to stay, or at least walk back with someone.
I did not.
I knew this was coming thanks to my two and a half years of dreadful, regrettable experience with my ex, and I was happy to let the energy of her explosion carry her far from us.
As she made her final arrangements to depart, my mom and I followed some cheerful beerlads to the summit of the mountain.
We stood and chatted with them and a nice couple camping there as the sun drifted down the open sky.
It shone through wispy clouds and made lakes glow until endless mountains hid it from our view.
I've seen many sunsets;
this one was the most exhilarating.
The lifting of our greatest burden made it that much sweeter.
</p>
<p>
<h2>324 546 768 98A, Windy Starry Twilight of the End of the Day</h2>
A breakfast of ice cream marked the start of our loftiest day so far.
We found ourselves intermittently in the company of a Kentucky man who calls himself
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@garysnextadventure">Papa Bear</a>;
he comes from a dirt-poor family, but by some fluke of genetics wound up being a leftist, so he is estranged from his siblings and hates his state.
As morning became afternoon, we drew ever closer to the first nation-state border of the trail.
Just before reaching it I had the good fortune to discover a recently felled laurel suitable for use as a walk-mobile device, and with some frantic secret sawing it became mine to keep.
At last, beneath the hot southern sun, we crossed the Official Georga-Carolinia State Limen Marker Plaque, complete with a user-submitted line in the dirt.
Not 30 yards later we came to our campsite.
We consumed some genuine Knorr trail slop with the Ursine Father and his Yale-grad hikin' bud, who calls herself Bluebird.
As we cleaned and wiped our messy slimy food pots, a mother strolled by with 13 of her 15 children.
Don't worry--we captured them on camera.
After a trip to the special tree for sunfall, we retired;
just now BearDad's third ally has arrived at camp.
He ought to stake down his tent well, because this night is foretold to bring with it some foul weather.

<h2>3/23/23/23/23/23, The Same Time Of Day As Almost Every Other One Of These Entries</h2>
Two bard owls punctuated last night's rainfall with their frenzied song.
Perhaps they were laughing as we slept.
The morning was gloriously dry; a brief jog down the mountain brought us to our NASA-approved transportation device, which swung us Around The Bend to tonight's hôtel.
This hôtel occupies an intermediate position on the hotel-hôtel spectrum.
It's not a crack house, which is a plus, but it is still rather communal and chaotically run.
Our host is John Lennon from circa 1970.
He seems to have acquired some customs on his 1968 Indian Approprition Expedition, in particular the endlessly fascinating diagonal head bobble that accompanies every spoken word.
We managed to hitch a ride on a crewed ISS resupply into town, which ejected us at the least convenient possible location to go shopping.
A couple highway crossings later and we nonetheless had all the nummy munchies we need for the big days ahead.
We gobbled up a geriatrically early supper out on the town, followed by a spot of iced cream, and returned to the hot hôtel, where I bought a carbon fiber compliant-mechanism umbrella (fancy variety).
We also nabbed a couple larger stuffel bags for our hangbeds, which should make packing up less strenuous.
There are promises of a continental breakfast in the morning--very European.
If we survive tomorrow's climb I pinkie swear to write again.
Love, Your Big Wet Teddy Bear

<h2>Three Twenty Two, Electric Boogaloo, 6:25 Named Clive</h2>
After the sun set last night, I was treated to a view of distant city lights, at once inspiring awe and reminding me of the industrial creep that threatens my future property.
I dreamt about a fictitious episode of Black Mirror, a show I have never seen and know almost nothing about, until my sleep was briefly disrupted by some earlier-than-forecast rain.
It tinkled as we packed our things, as we mudsurfed for miles, and as we arrived at tonight's wooden structure of habitation and erected our flies.
A break in the great drip allowed us to hang the bed bananas without moistening them, but it soon resumed, so we resigned to heating and eating our Trail Slop cuisine with the huddled sleepers-to-be.
More progress was made towards astroturfing that term into the public consciousness.
One of the sheltermen tonight is a familiar face; he is stout and bearded, smokes a pipe, and calls himself Furlong.
He is from "Nahampsha."
The day is not yet waning, but still sleep nears.
Becoming dry will be a puzzle.
If the worst should befall us we will be in another hôtel next afternoon.
</p>

<h2>3/21 = 1/7 haha fraction gag, the Part of the Day After Dinner but Before You Finish Staking Your Rain Fly</h2>
Steep day, very steep.
Steep step.
Down a mountain, up a mountain, down a mountain, up a mountain.
Seedle peeled off after the first descent on account of her fucked leg;
as she did so, we became acquainted with Smoky the Bear, who gave us his number.
Then we carried on.
Several of the strutters we encountered on the way to our destination are holing up next to us tonight--a rowdier bunch than I would have, but hopefully they will shut their holes before too long.
They say little of note anyway, except for a seasoned man who calls himself K-Dog.
He amuses me.
The sun has withdrawn behind the clouds and mountains, but continues to illuminate the sprawling, rolling landscape below our ridge, making it glow as a field of wheat at harvest time.
A blue jay's feather graces our ground.
My name is John Muir, and you're reading Nature Words, Overused Quotes, and Other Forgotten Ramblings, Volume 37.

<h2>Springe's Firstest Day, Looming Scungset</h2>
You know what they say: after two longs, a short must follow.
Nowhere is this truer than in the backcountry.
We slept in and schlepped out a brief seven mighles at record pace, thanks to the mild terraigne and absence of our burdenous Hiking Associate for most of the trip.
Snacks were eaten.
Our fabric accomodations are strung up this evening on a ridge overlook at the 50 mile increment marking indicator sigil;
we are joined by several surprisingly tolerable people, including two oldies and one mildly injured young lass whom I will call Seedle.
We expect her to join our wayfaring party on the morrow as she fares down the gap to rest up her knee.
Each day now the air warms, and if the big luck dealer stays on our side of the court it should be an easy few stints into the next town.
</p>

<h2>Threem Nimeteem, the End of a Gentle Pink Sunset</h2>
Today was a big day for us.
Not a Big Boy day--that will have to wait a couple months--but still our biggest day so far.
It was also very TrailMagical ;) !
Two separate bands of warlocks assembled to provide us with yummy eatins and a scrumptious dessert treat.
They even gifted us an incantation.
Before, between, and after these lil rests, we went up and down, up and down, lots.
Two more lads entered our orbital periphery: one who calls himself White Oak, and one who I will call Jersey Jeff.
With their unwitting aid, we were able to spend much of the day out of hearing range of our Hiking Associate, who has of late begun calling herself Squeeze.
May tomorrow be similarly quiet.
Near the end of the day, a guardian presented us with a fork in the road.
We took the right path.
Now, with plump tummies and emptied bladders, we hunker down for another bitterly cold night.
</p>
<p>
<h2>3/18 = 1/6, so it is "Insurrection" Day, at It Smells Like Fucking Cigarettes In This Bunk House o'clock</h2>
I am in an insane place.
I don't throw that term around willee nillee; people, places, and things have to earn the designation.
This place has done so beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Our hike today was not as difficult as I was anticipating--a recurring trend, it seems, methinks, it would appear.
We found the top of an early hill to be frosted, with ice growing sideways off stems and branches under the force of the wind.
On our approach to Blood Mountain, we came across two middle-aged southbound women warning us that the climb ahead was "a sheet of ice" with winds "easily 20 miles an hour."
They told us we needed to take the bypass trail.
They were "saving lives left and right today."
When I ascertained that they had not in fact been on the mountain, I began to doubt their claims.
We decided to ignore them and pressed on, finding the conditions balmy and whimsical.
Atlantis could be sighted from the summit.
A steep descent carried us to a disgraceful tourist gift shop full of trinkets and useless plastic doodads;
to make matters worse, a group of three inbred hicks who had been harassing our Hiking Associate earlier in the day were sitting outside drinking monster and beer.
Fortunately,we absconded away with our resupply boxes and caught our NASA shuttle to tonight's hôtel.
Arriving, it became immediately clear that last night's hôtel was really more on the hotel end of the spectrum.
This place is a genuine hôtel.
I spent a fair amount of the evening in a loaner shirt with an atomic structure diagram of LSD on it;
my mother, our Hiking Associate, a fellow inhabiter, and one of the owners all donned onezies;
an overweight man in his 50s and a fluorescent yellow beanie would not shut up (he is currently on the bunk below me, finally quiet);
a bearded old smoker in a cowboy hat lurked mute until he finally muttered "that's too funny";
a profoundly, inexplicably, indescribably, frighteningly weird couple(?) from Illinois(?) who we passed on our first day arrived (one is very thin with his(?) long hair in a bun, the other does not talk and turns his head very slowly like the weird kid you saw in gym in high school and can't remember the name of);
the whole house appears normal at first glance, but the longer you spend in it the more it becomes clear that all of the interior decorating and arranging is the product of weed- and shroom-addled minds, slowly infecting you with their cluttered but tasteful psychosis, driving you to dissociation.
I swear to the Anointed Christ Geesus on the Rood that I am not making any of this up.
Which reminds me, the place is Christian.
Christian LSD: the new aesthetic of the southern Appalachians.
I am done for the night.

<h2>Kiss an IRA Bomber Day, Lights Out Time for the Kiddos</h2>
Today was a wet day, as in there was a lot of water making things wet.
The water was coming from God.
God managed to get many things wet, including my feet, but our UltraTech Synthetic Dyneeema Dry Tarp Rainproof BPA-free* Fly Covers protected the essential goods and services.
After a short jaunt of 4.08 nautical miles, we recruited the remains of NASA's failed Space Shuttle program to ferry us to a hôtel.
Our driver was a congenial and pleasant interlocutor.
At the accommodations we enjoyed Pope John's 16-incher and hung some moist ones in the closet.
And the best part is: we get to stay in a hôtel again tamorrow!
I'm really looking forward to experiencing these back to back new experiences.
There are hôtels all over the fucking place!
I must also make two addenda to yestaday's report.
First, my number one priority goal mission on the trail--astroturfing "trail slop" into an accepted term for trail food--began last night as a beautifully smooth opportunity to "coin" the term was handed to me by Knox.
This gives me hope for the future.
And second, I recieved an ancient First Nations blessing while setting up my hammock in the form of a golden Sacagawea in the dirt.
I may only be $1 richer, but my spiritual wealth has exploded tenfold.
May the good vibes and energy wiggles propagate into the morning, when we shall attempt our biggest day yet and cross Blood Mountain (blood sacrifice optional but strongly encouraged).
</p>
<p>
<h2>16/3, Starry Late Eve</h2>
We were generously serenaded last night by a pack of coyotes engaged in spirited debate.
Their vocalizations lulled us into a deep sleep.
After waking this morning and beginning our quotidian labor, we found that our orbit of leapfroggers had at once been sundered and grown.
The Homonyms and The Lovers fell a bit behind our pace, and three lads filled the power vacuum: one who calls himself Chopsticks, and two who I will refer to as Haverford and Knox.
Amidst the echoes of machine gun fire, Chopsticks warned us of the coming storm; we ignored him until the schizophrenic meteorological prognosticators confirmed his fears, then elected to cut tomorrow short and take cover in a hôtel.
Our late afternoon was spent mostly in a dusty forest, where Haverford and Knox made a few stabs at appellating me Stylin' or Einstein--I successfully rebuffed their advances.
We have come to rest a few hundred feet downslope of the communal shelter our Hiking Associate elected to inhabit, so the night is pleasantly calm.
I look forward to a wet morning that should put our gears and cogs to the exam.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Assassination Day, the First White Blaze Nightfall</h2>
Our morning began with a climb up Mound Springus to the southerlimost terminad of the trail proper.
I am rapidly coming to understand that the average fitness of Mainewalk attempters is much lower than you might otherwise expect;
the difficulty of trail segments is consistently overreported, and we seem to pass others frequently.
On a brighter side, our Hiking Association has agglomerated two pair of ragtag rapscallions as intermittent stroll buddies.
One I will refer to as The Homonyms, and the other as The Lovers.
We encountered our first Wizard in a parking lot, who called himself Doc Holliday and could conjure food items from an automobile;
permuted amongst ourselves through the length of a lush grove of laurels, rhododendra, and virgin hemlock;
and paused to enjoy the roar of a strange and rare formation in which a creek rapdily changes altitude and the water apears to fall.
We now retire nestled on a sloping but well-constructed series of tent flats and hammock nooks.
Dinner was warm.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Pie in the Calendrical Sky, the Part of the Day When It Is Cold</h2>
Reports of Amicalola Stairs' difficulty were greatly exaggerated.
I'm not sure how unfit you'd have to be to struggle with them, but suffice to say you shouldn't be hiking.
We enjoyed a leisurely stroll up them after receiving our TrailSat Wireless Tracking Number Tag Registration Card from the relevant agency, and in the process came to meet our first official Hiking Associate.
She is like a cross between my ex-girlfriend and my best friend's youngest sister, except she's ten years older than them.
We hiked and waddled, climbed and philosophized, tumbled and scrumbled.
This evening we performed an initiatory fire ritual with the sundry hippies, scrappy retirees, vagrants, locutionary wizards, and bona fide trekkers inhabiting our campsite.
It was grand.
As I write now, it is a crispy 34 Fahrenheits, and the ashes of our creation smolder beneath a gently occident sun.
A long night awaits.
</p>
<p>
<h2>three/thirteen, Gettin' Ready for Beddy</h2>
I just finished watching an hour-long video on electrolyte balance at the request of my mother.
I gained no significant insight from this experience; I plan to retain my habit of getting electro-lit roughly once a day.
Juice taste good, Cole like juice.
Nothing remains to be done before our departure in the morning.
Our lodge overlooks the falls we will be climbing after completing our pack weigh-in and No Touch Only Look orientation session at the visitor center.
660 stairs are rumored to lie between there and here.
We will do our best, but I cannot guarantee the continued existence of our legs and cardiovascular systems after climbing them.
We plan to trek a leisurely 7 miles to ease us into the groove, or rhythm, also known as habitary custom.
The serene eve bodes well, I think.
Let me know what you think.
What do you think, reading person?
Do you think the serene eve bodes well?
I do.

<h2>Twelmar, Post-Supper Stupor</h2>
Someone should alert the authorities that France and the Live Oak Militia are launching an all-out assault on the southeastern seaboard.
There's sous vide, crème brûlée, défenêtrations nônchâlântes, waxy green leaves all over our beautiful hardwood floors - this miscarriage of justice cannot stand.
Fortunately, we pooled our meager intellects in the manner of congress and arrived at a plan to retaliate with our mouths and a screened-in porch.
The latest reports from the front indicate that the enemy was successfully neutralized.
We should all take away the following lesson from this experience: the mouth is a powerful and dextrous tool apt for many diverse persuasions and persuasive acts.
Beyond battle, not much happened today.
I self-administered some cognitive evaluations and confimed my longstanding suspicion that I am severely impaired.
Probably there is no hope for me; my mind rots and rots from hour to hour like that of so many men my age.
At least Papa Fed is bailing out all the friendly California executives who have only our best interest in mind.
Thank you, Tim Apple!
Thank you, Algore!
Thank you, Jay Powell!
Say this prayer three times, then take the seed underfoot and shake a twig of birch.

<h2>3/11, Early Evening as the Pearl-Sun is Weaning</h2>
We are atop a large building overlooking town from a distance.
A well-timed jump from this height could take out at least two groundwalkers, maybe three.
The day has been marked by time travel:
we began with a trip to Rhode Island in 1952, where we discovered that Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings;
then we leapfrogged to a near-future hellscape where all manner of goblins, ghouls, "artists," pigs in strollers, dyed-hair agitators, horsecops, and complacent shoppers gather at something called a "farmers' market";
and lastly, craving a return to stately tradition, we transported ourselves back to the good old past and enjoyed some ice cream cones Biden-style.
What the evening will bring is yet to be determined.
I do know that bananas will be involved, at least in spirit.
The spirit of bananas is strong here. Their joy and unreserved expression of self is something rarely seen in people their age.
We should all be more like bananas.
More from me tomorrow, when the crew gets the whole gang together and eats as a team.
</p>
<p>
<h2>10 Marsh 2023hree, late in the late part of the day</h2>
Tonight we consulted with a psychic at an old vault.
She had nothing whatsoever of import to say about our trip.
Maybe next time.
There were a number of odd synchronicities, coincidences, and fun little joyous moments, however, which point me to order a taco from a restaurant in Radnor in the fall.
Then the craving shall be quenched, and we shall see what it is all about.
As the day of departure, or d-day as I like to call it, draws nearer to the present moment, in that strange manner in which time draws and creeps and keeps,
I think to myself, as I so often do in these moments and those like them, such as before other major times of departure, movement, or change, for instance my starting collage, or the other time,
that, in this manner and nearing quickly like a freight train, barreling at me like a truck, rushing at me like a large solid object moving at high speed, which frequently happens.
I think those who can will know what a companion this can be for such a man.
This one is a poem: O great spirit in the night, keep the stary sky so bright, like a glowing glitter cup, to distract my grandfather from his dog that will not shut up
</p>

<h2>Marche the Ninth, Sultry Midafternoon</h2>
I am in the middle of a nearly twelve-hour car ride travelling the distance we intend to hike in about 90 days.
Cars are faster than people.
I've just discovered the existence of Arizona Fruit Snacks, the packaging of which will make a fine and dandy addition to my growing Arizona Tarot.
I believe the Snacks are almost three times as expensive as a classic can; they don't taste like it.
The checkerboard motif reoccurs once again on the top of the bag.
I am convinced it is speaking to me.
It is saying, "summersummersummersummersummersummer."
It speaks in whispers and hisses, but I can still hear it if I strain my cochlea.
Summersummersummersummersummersummer.
