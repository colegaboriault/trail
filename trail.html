<h1>The Great Walk</h1>
<p>
<h2>Aperil Sevength, Late Late Time for Bed</h2>
The Clingman Clime was, like most things out here in the backcountry wilderwoods, not as difficult as anticipated.
For the first few miles we hiked through a thunderstorm, which I had not done before and enjoyed greatly.
Then the rain lifted for a time and afforded us some views of the smoky (also known as fogness or cloud material) that the mountains are named for.
We stopped at a shelter with a fire just as driplets began to fall once more, and an hour or so later stopped at another shelter without a fire but with a uniquely bizzarre privy sporting wheelchair instructions
(just across the border into Carolinia of course, but I guess even they have some aggressive ADA lobbyists to contend with).
At this point the forest abruptly became coniferous and began to resemble Cascadia.
The rain made the trees and moss glisten until the clouds miraculously lifted again to reveal one of the most spectacular views I have seen in my life.
As we climbed higher, the view got better.
It could have been a perfect hike, but my mother insisted that we divert from the trail early to reach the summit a few minutes quicker, leaving both the highest point on the whole trail and the 200 mile mark for Sunday.
We passed a false 200 mile sign made of sticks (whoever put it there is an idiot, it's literally on a paved road instead of the trail), and just as we climbed the curvaceous concrete interpretive observational structure ramp the fog blew in and blocked the view.
We began walking down the pavement to the parking lot; within 5 minutes the view was back.
If we had gone my way we would have had the high point, 200 miles, and an incredible 360-degree unobstructed view to end the day.
Sometimes people make bad decisions, and we have to remember that they are only human, and most humans have remarkably feeble minds.
Reaching the tourist- and syllabary-filled parking lot, we were greeted by Papa Bear and Mama Bear, who drove us down the mountain and straight into the next phase of my grandplan scheme: Operation Pigeonhole.
I've been laying the groundwork for this since we decided to hike the trail, and it all came to fruition as we drove down that potently cursed road into the frenetic, cartoonish vacation mecca the people call Pigeon Forge.
We are tourist tourists: not only here to see the garish attractions, but to study the tourism generated by them.
An early dinner at Shoney's gave us time to book accommodations, and--without my input--my mother fell for one of the classic blunders, selecting a delighfully seedy cheap motel based on its appealing name.
It is across the street from an upside-down building.
This was a stretch goal for me, so I am over the moon that we managed to achieve such cultural immersion.
After some showers, Papa Bear suggested we go out for icy cream--no complaints from me.
Back down the main strip we drove in our "pajamas" (laundry is a morning problem) to a bustling joint operated by the friendly local Moldovan immigrants; creams were consumed and fudges were purchased.
With the smile of a kid in a candy store, Papa Bear declared that he needed a half-gallon of chocolate milk.
In its customary way, Publix swooped in from across the street to satisfy his desire and afford us an opportunity to replenish our provisions.
I can now say I have purchased granola bars from the Publix in Pigeon Forge at night while wearing skin-tight patterned thermal leggings.
It is quite late, but there is no need to fret, for we have elected to take a Caligula (appropriate given the decadent insanity) tomorrow.
It ought to be a wild time, but it won't be able to beat this incredible very good excellent day, which I am officially deeming 99% perfect.
</p>
<p>
<h2>April Sixthstsths, Waitin' for Dinner to Soak</h2>
The intermittent drizzle began when God and I peed simultaneously this morning.
Over the following few hours He moistened everything and everyone with His gentle spray;
this set the scene for a dreamy, wonderful, madgical day.
We legged ourselves through fairyland forests (the fairies are midges, flies, and gnats), dense laurel thickets, and gentle mountaintop meadows with rocky spots and scenic viewing overlook sights.
After dipping back into Carolinia for a brief privy session we began hiking in the company of Snuggie.
We zenithed Rockletop, from which Mound Springus could be picked out amongst the ridges and peaks, and then traversed to Aunt Jemima's Bisquick Thunderdome.
On the final stretch of the day I managed to spot one of the Ruffled Grousers we have been hearing for about 100 miles:
alerted by the rustling of leaves in time with its usual wing drums, I scrambled up a small mound and spent a good minute staring straight at it before I realized it was perched pensively on a log.
The shelter situation tonight is nearly the same as the last.
A big sloppy meal is in order, for tomorrow we tackle the Dome, rain or shine.
Mr. Clingman ain't even gonna know what even hit him!
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/5 Stars (Pretty Good But I Have Some Constructive Criticism), After Dinner After The Previous Post</h2>
Have you heard of stream of consciousness writing?
Pleasant breakfast, still no letter.
We have done our best to forward it.
The shuttle pilot was different today, slightly more competent, but they still didn't understand that when you have multiple destinations you need to load the trunk in reverse order.
Tetris Prank Gone Wrong (Gone Sexual) Police Were Called!
Got back to Fontana Dan eventually.
If anybody has been searching for the whereabouts of the literal gates of hell, we found them there.
It was very hot by the time we started walking.
Crossing Dan was not too bad, nor was the pavement up to the permit box (thank you retiree for telling us where it was in excruciating detail), but as soon as we started climbing I was toast.
Too hot for coal.
I was literally dripping sweat--I cannot remember the last time that happened.
Big beads of sweat rolled down my shining brow as I exerted myself.
I was a sticky wet boy.
A few snakes stopped by to laugh at me (not our first, that was yesterday, forgot to mention it, OOPS HAHA!).
At last we gained the ridgeline, as the mountaineers say, and a stiff Tennisy breeze blew away the North Carolinia heat and hot.
Up shucklestack we went, then up the most sy-gogglin firetower I've climbed in all my days for a nice windy birdeye view of the surrounding mountains and hills and orogenic sceneries.
Down and up again brought us to the fawn fairyland of Yggdrasil, which was pretty cool.
Worth climbing in April.
Not much to speak of until the shelter, which is of stone construction and would be the nicest one we've stayed near if not for the multitude of inconveniences caused by being in Tennisy.
Awful bureacratic stuff.
There are signs saying to boil all the water here.
Leftover signage from the '70s?
Legitimate warning?
Nobody knows.
There are a few mentions that we need to somehow hang our bear canisters--the whole point of those is you don't hang them.
But we must comply, so up go our backpacks to hang in the overnight rain.
And there are no privies at these shelters.
Why?
The really flamboyant one, who calls himself Flowers, very probably has the answer: in Tennisy they would have to be (drumroll) ADA accessible.
Genuine Brazil-tier insanity.
So now we are camping just uphill of the shelter's designated shitfield.
Time's up, mommy wants her phone back.
Goodnight online person!
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/4 = 1 ALERT WE HAVE REACHED UNITY, Late Day After a Dumpster Stay</h2>
To our relief, the Turbo-Preschoolers quieted down a little while after I finished writing.
An hour or so later a large pack of coyotes began to howl at the waxing moon--very exciting very cool!
Novelty item in the woods!
(While writing this I was visited by a small bee; I fear he may have misunderstood and thought that the novelty item was on the phonescreen. I greeted him, but he quickly flew away when he ascertained the quality of my prose.)
In a handful of locutionary beats that are still beyond my understanding, the howling initiated a loud Turbo-Conversation about Florida and the housing market.
Eventually my mother activated her maternal discipline and instructed the offenders to "please continue the conversation in the morning."
Sleep soon followed.
The following day started out muggy and buggy with enough haze to wash out our views, but the mood flipped when we descended through an impressively lush slope full of many plant leaves and petals.
Our progress was slowed by at least five individual varieties of trilium among other flora.
Reaching water level, we passed the Fontana Marinara, trotted lakeside to the Fontana Hilton (where I peed in the toilet for more novelty), and roadwalked down to meet Fontana Dan himself.
He is a big ugly concrete structure.
As we understood things, we were to enter the visitors center, which was Built For The People Of The United States, and phone for a shuttle to our accomodational area.
We walked in and asked the retiree at the desk if we could phone for a shuttle.
She said, "yes," then walked us over to the display and began her very gradual lecture on the construction of the Dan.
Father Beowulf wisely slipped out around this time.
After several minutes of useless information about factories that make and roll out aluminum into sheets, do you know what those are called?
Well anyway those kinds of factories, we quietly walked over to ask the other retiree at the desk if we could phone for a shuttle.
He said, "yes," and handed us a phone.
We waited; he spoke at us slowly about the precise layout of the hiking permit box.
The shuttle landed nominally (no damaged foam tiles on this mission--it's always a crapshoot with the management at NASA).
We boarded with tired haste, but our efficiency turned out to be in vain: the pilot went inside and willingly conducted an entire conversation with the retirees about a nearby electric car charger.
When he damn well pleased, he got back into the vehicle, turned on the Grateful Dead, and began flying a circuitous and highly suboptimal route to our destination.
On the way we found Jeffy again.
Landing at the Prime 1970s Dancing Vacation Destination, we picked up our self-care packages, showered immediately, and dressed up in our finest rainy day suits to go walk to the laundromat.
Why walk when it's hot and sunny and we're wearing waterproof clothing?
Well, we tried to phone for the shuttle again, but after waiting over 20 minutes we figured the pilot had found more retirees to discuss car chargers with and took a stroll.
We sat and watched the washers tumble with some other washer watchers;
ice cream would have been next door, but Due to lack of Employees the Ice Cream Shop will not open this season We are sorry for this inconvenience!!
A nearby extortionist gas station satiated my creamlust, and a maintainence magician rolled in shortly after to toss us some Girl Scout Pyramid Scheme Biscuits.
But it was too late--my headache had already begun.
Out came the clothes and up we went to the resturant.
We ate your typical very large meal of large foods for large people; even this failed to quell the headache.
Back up to the lodge, where we learned that general postal incompetence would prevent me from receiving a letter I had been anticipating for over a week.
The headache worsened.
Back to our room for calls, organization, hiker trades, rapid cleaning of pots, using tiny cups to fill our bottles with the worst tap water I have ever tasted, packing.
Too much.
Most of our planned activities would have to wait for yet another town day.
By this point I was in quite some pain and deleriously tired, so I dropped everything and just went to bed while Trail Mom (our Hiking Associate is frighteningly close behind us according to Jiff) attempted to mail a package back home.
I didn't even get to write the bloging post!
Can you believe that reader!
I apologize deeply and profoundly for my severe and continuous lapse of judgement.
Please don't punish me for the delay.
I cannot take any more whippings, beatings, or assaults on my person.
</p>
<p>
<h2>4/3 Is An Improper Fraction So You Need To Split It Into Integral And Fractional Parts, Bedtime Before Sunset</h2>
Do not be misled by the whining and complaining of others at our campsite: today was an easy and pleasant hike.
We saw mildly interesting flowers, mildly interesting rocks, and other mildly interesting things that
"MIKE HOWS THE QUILT"
you might see in the woods.
There was a spat of sprinkled drizzle around midday,
"I WAS GETTIN SO MAD AT YOU ALBERT"
but
"I ALMOST HAD TO SWING MY BEAR LINE OVER A TREE AND GO AROUND THE OTHER SIDE"
even that could not break the mildly interesting streak.
"I WAS WAITIN FOR YOU GUYS TO CATCH UP WITH ME"
We waited out out the worst of it while eating lunch in
"A LITTLE ERIC CLAPTON BLUES *loud music*"
a peculiar shelter with a gap in the
"MIKE HOWS THAT QUILT DOIN"
floor.
The rest of the day was smooth sailing, as the sailors say.
Rolling into camp, we were pleased to see a Pencilvania man we have been encountering who calls himself Chex Mix, and while we ate dinner Snuggie joined the party.
Our jubilational good vibe zone was sudddenly
"HOW YOU DOIN SUZIE, WARMIN UP?"
broken, however, when we realized that
"OKAY I THINK IM GETTIN INTO BED NOW"
the shelter's vicinity was populated by the same disgraceful people who wouldn't shut up last night.
The youth crowd spent an infuriatingly long time engaged in loud conversation right by our hammocks (not anywhere near their tents), but the worst offenders tonight are actually some middle- to old-aged siblings.
They're all in their tents and hammocks already, but every few minutes one of them shouts to the others and interrupts my train of thought.
I have no idea what makes them think this is acceptable behavior.
If I hear one more outburst from them I will send them back to Turbo-Preschool, which is a lot like regular preschool (teaching the alphabet, basic manners, which Eric Clapton songs are good and which ones are bad) except instead of being punished with a time out I come piss on your tent.
"TO THINK TOM AND ALBERT YOU GET TO SEE YOUR WIVES TOMORROW"
Looks like the tent pisser will strike for the first time this evening.
</p>
<p>
<h2>April 2: "We Doin' April Again", Calm Early Evening Punctuated by Twenty-Somethings Making Normie-Tier OnlyFans Jokes Three Years After They Stopped Being Funny (Hahahahahahahahaa)</h2>
As the suns rise and fall, we creep ever closer to the limits of what I have done.
Today we surpassed the 4000 foot ascent mark for the first time on this trip.
My personal record is over a mile, so I'm not breaking barriers and exploring new horizons of progress and change yet, but this is still respectable.
The climb did not present us with any substantive difficulty.
Still, my knees were not quite entirely satisfied to their utmost and greatest comfort during our meager descent.
Jeffuel decided to stop short and rest up his blistering toeskin, but BearDad is keeping a common schedule with us.
Our campsite was promisingly sparse when we arrived in the afternoon and began to hang our hanging items, but over the next several hours a steady stream of mostly youthful arrivals tiled the narrow gap floor with their tenting arrangements.
Only then did it occur to me how little difference there is between AT campsites and homeless encampments; they definitely have comparable rates of drug posession and use.
Maybe the police will arrive and use their nightsticks to gently remind the youth that others are trying to sleep.
If not, I am equipped with bear spray.
</p>
<p>
<h2>APRIL FOOL! HAHA YOU GO T FOOLED! YOU ARE A GULIBLE PERSON! at Past My Bedtime</h2>
We have had a few Nerones already, but today was the first of our unscheduled Caligulae.
The wind forecast worsened overnight to include gusts of over one mile per minute, and with the added water weight from last night's torrent on the limbes and branjes, the mob psyche concluded that hiking out was not a safe option (you will find that the mob psyche is very safety cautious).
A group rationalization followed the decision.
My mother, Papi Oso, our host, and a woman who calls herself Brightside elaborated at some length that this was definitely the right choice, that we were putting safety first and being responsible even if it meant not making progress, and that when hiking the AT&T it's better to avoid injury than push it too far--they were surprisingly full of trail wisdom for never having done this before.
I resigned to the will of the crowd and began killing time by carving.
A woman staying here mounted an expedition to the grocer and provided sandwich fixings and donuts pro bono, which ate another hour or so.
At one point the forest janny came over to check out my stick.
After some conversation we discovered a Big Boy coincidence: he and his brother and me and my brother independently invented the term Big Boy Hike to refer to any hike longer than 20 miles with more than a mile of gain.
He then gifted me a knife, which adds him to the list of people who have gifted me knives.
Not much else happened.
If all goes as planned, we will be on the move again tomorrow, where I am excited to see what may be a truly hellish level of wind damage and trailcrossing treefalls.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Final Day of the Great Month of Marching, Dimly Trombone-lit Nighttime</h2>
Today's allotment of soil was not as deadly dull as yesterday's.
Though others cowered, we found the deep drops, scrams, and screes more amusing than foreboding;
the rest of the trail was graded just shallow enough to be uninteresting and just steep enough to be hard on the knees.
Arriving at the riparian tourist buffer, we exfiltrated our prearranged postal parcel and consumed an ample mid-day-eat before boarding the spacecraft bound for our booked beds.
The place we are staying is very progressive--it deconstructs the hotel-hôtel binary by branding itself a "boutique glamping resort."
It consists of several aggressively themed tiny houses: the Reel-It-Inn, the Red Woof Inn, some kind of yurt, a hairy poder themed one, the Chicken Coop, and a literal schoolbus are among them, but ours is New Orleans Style.
We have old brass wind wallhangers, Louis Armstrong portraits, fleurs-de-lis, and mardi gras paraphernalia.
The whole establishment would be tacky if it weren't so unreasonably well done.
The woman responsible for it all is a genuine hoot and sharp as a whipcrack.
She worked in advertising before typesetting and illustration were digitized, and the meticulous attention to motes of detail cultivated in that field has carried over to her present occupation.
One of the youthful lads she employs also works as a Forest Service janny;
we heard him warn some slackers about naughty homicidal trees at a tentsite down the road, so we decided to consult him on our plan to camp tomorrow in 50 mile-per-hour winds.
When we explained that we were in hammocks, a crazed flash illuminated his face and caused his eyes to widen.
"Oh. OH. I hadn't thought of that... man, that's a hot idea!"
We may be seeing him at camp tomorrow.
I've just enjoyed a little oreo ice cream cup as a late night snack, and once I brush my teeth I'll be gettin in bed with a full tummy.
Full tummy bedtimes are my favorite bedtimes because I am a fat fucking glutton.
Join me on my quest for meaning in this nightmare world of soul-harvesting consumption: eat sweet treats and sleep.
</p>
<p>
<h2>3/30 (A Nice Round Number As You Can See), Dust Time</h2>
A late start this morning began a completely uneventful day of hiking.
Nothing of note happened.
The second half of our route was somewhat dead, dusty, and unpleasant;
even climbing a fire tower with a clear view of the smokies was a dry experience.
Camp is run-of-the-mill and lightly populated.
We interacted briefly at dinner with a colorfully dressed man whom Wendy referred to as "the really flamboyant one"--an apt moniker, considering he speaks only in his falsetto range.
I can tell he doesn't just have a high voice both by his strained timbre and because whenever he laughs, makes involuntary vocalizations, or imitates a man, he uses his underlying modal voice, which is alarmingly deep for his affected persona.
Strange people out here in appalachialand.
Tomorrow we descend for six miles straight into the KNOCK--KNantahala Outdoor CenterK--which may be unpleasant on the knees and feets and other parts of the leg device.
If the terrain is as dusty as today I will begin slaying fellow hikers so that their blood wets the earth.
And another addendum: yesterday there was a strange basement alcove in the firetower on the second bald.
Inside it wasa single empty can of Pabst Blue Ribbon.
Have the beerlads been here?
</p>
<p>
<h2>329 4216 5225 6236, The Morning After Because It Was Too Damn Cold</h2>
As we gathered our gatherings and assembled our assemblies in preparation for departing the motel, something remarkable happened:
Mark Zuckleman personally delivered us a notice that the government was setting the trail on fire.
This little monkey of a development threw a wrench in our plans to start the big day early.
Jefferald decided to spend another day in town and dip his heel in the stygian waters, while we, Ursus Pater, and Ursa Mater awaited the all-clear go-ahead at a waffle dealer sans waffles.
The meal was full of kindred spirit.
Lacking a status update after billing up, we trucked on into the gap to hobnob with the government arsonists and stooges in hopes of extracting their incendiary intelligence.
They had none.
We sat around for a few hours until the pyropter finally swung by and the ridge began to smoke.
Then, with our Forest Service Detainment over, we began hiking around 3 pm.
An initial climb took us straight through the path of the flames--abundant smoke to inhale, ashen forest floor, burning leaf litter, flaming snags, and even a dud firebomb were among the scenery of the obliquely lit afternoon.
Eventually we reached a bald and climbed to the top through flaming meadows.
I endowed my walking stick with a char feature as we took in the unobstructed 2pi radian view.
A runner's high carried me to the next bald, where we climbed a fire tower and saw the reddest setting sun of my life before descending into camp--a record pace for our trip.
The shelter was unexpectedly packed.
We set up and ate in dark red silence before climbing beneath our quilts.
Despite the freezing temperature, we were warm.
</p>
<p>
<h2>328 4216 5232 6264, Not Sure Exactly What Time It Is (Solar Wise, I Am Typing On A Smardphone With A Clock) Because Of The Blinds</h2>
Beggels, yoghurt, creen cheen, garnola, mufflins, granberries, coughee--it was a bekfast of chanpioms.
The hôtel hôts were reserved, yet jovial; calm, yet exuberantly kind.
Fueled and cooled, we made our merry way to the launchpad which costs millions of dollars of taxpayer money, think about that seriously for a moment, and Blasted Off! back to the head of the trail.
Step up, step down.
Step all around!
Step step step.
Coming down the steps we stepped right up to our familymember, who calls herself Chef Cocoa.
She flew us to the resupply, to the motel, to a tasty long lunch, and back to the motel, dishing out tips, wisdom, and gear bits the whole time.
It was a wonderful and generous reunion.
Papa Bear and Jersey Jeff are at the same motel, so we all rounded ourselves up into a round with Papa Bear's Lady Friend in accompaniment and sauntered over to the local latin watering hole to meet some fellow walkers and talkers.
I ate food; others wasted away.
Under unexpectedly smokey skies we now retire in our hopefully bedbugless arrangements.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Marge Twendy Semen, Chica and Well Past Sunsets</h2>
The thunderstorms in the forecast unfortunately missed us;
we heard some thunder and saw some lightning, but the meat and potatoes of the real action skirted just to our south.
I was hoping for more hammock-swingin' wind.
My consolation prize was climbing up some fun rock embellishments in the trail to the 100 mile fire tower, marking 100 miles in this 100 mile journey.
I feel so moved, it's almost like I've moved 100 miles.
What an emotional moment for me.
I am a very emotional woman.
In the early afternoon we were picked up by our Exclusive NASACAR Driver and flown by space to the Exclusive Hôtel for Exclusive People.
By coincidence, the only other Exclusive Person staying here is Wendy from Freedom Day.
After cleaning our beans we docked to the ISS and went out on the small town.
We dined at a USDA Forest Service Certified Free-Range Organic Soil Conservation No-Till Permaculture Local GMO-Free Wellness Animal Health Wholesome Farm-to-Table establishment.
I ate a bird, and my mom ate a fish.
FroYo Bro (No Mo' Po' Ho's) stood in for a proper ice creem desert.
We ran into a few highkers on the lil main street of this cute lil village whose economy is completely dependent on AT tourism, making the livelihood of most people here fundamentally at risk, and signed their cute lil AT banner. Now we are going to bed.
My mom is snoring.
Will I be able to fall asleep?
Find out on the next episode of Turn Off The Goddamn Screen You Lazy Piece Of Shit And Go Do Something Productive.

<p>
<h2>Marchie 2*13, End of a Hard Day's Workin' Hikin' Excursion'</h2>
A brief, light rain woke us this morning.
We took one last view from the summit, complete with about 10 degrees of a rainbow, and then made a slow ridgewise descent.
At several points we caught sight of the fire tower at the 100 Mile Markerino Award Center, which we will be passing tomorrow if tonight's thunderstorms don't kill us.
Lunch was taken at a run-down shelter where a prophecy inscribed on the walls warned us of KGB AI Demon Tech Mind Control.
A mangled bear canister was left there as a warning; fāma fert that a bear successfully broke into it a few nights ago.
We then passed through a very strange section of woods which hinted at some catastrophic event several years in the past--vast stretches of dead understory with only short living plants, an impressive number of wide treefalls, and generally unusual soil.
Eventually it gave way to regular forest, and eventually the regular forest gave way to non-bear-sanctuary regular forest.
Camping with us tonight are Jersey Jeff and Papa Bear, the two most pleasant people we have met who are still on trail, or entraille if you will.
Entraille is spelled as though it were a French word, and would therefore be pronounced similarly to the English phrase "on trail," making this a pun.
And one addend to last night's report: I somehow forgot to mention the crucial fact that the beerlads were drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon.
This beer choice foreshadowed the havoc they wrought when they returned to the shelter at the base of the mountain.
</p>
<p>
<h2>March 25th, A New Holiday Called "Freedom Day," 5450 Feet in the Evening</h2>
BIG day. Big League. Bam. BINGO!
The thunderstorm last night was ferocious and thrilling.
If you have never hammocked in a thunderstorm with 40-mile-per-hour winds, I <em>highly</em> recommend it.
You <em>have</em> to try it.
We got a late start in the morning, partly due to the storm, but mostly due to some amazing fantacular news:
through the divine power of elaborate roundabout nepotism, we have been gifted a stay at the most exclusive hôtel on the whole Ablation Trail.
Only exclusive people are allowed to stay there.
We will also have a personal NASA-approved shuttle pilot for our day in town.
After sorting and delivering our thanks to the requisite parties, we set out on our climb.
On the slopes of a mountain, we discovered that we are now within eyeball distance of the Smoking Hills.
Clingman's Dome (real name, I did not make this up) can be faintly made out among the distant ridges.
The mid-after-noon-time brought us to a TrailMagical operation of truly industrial scale.
Paralyzed by the unexpected multitude of choices, I settled on two samoas, a bag of cheez-its, and some Welch's fruit snacks.
A walk up the hill brought us to a very windy shelter inhabited by Wendy and some strange creatures disguized as twentysomethings.
Wendy encouraged us to follow our fears and stay put, but we duly ignored her, and upon the reappearance of our Hiking Associate and Jersey Jeff we resolved to camp atop Standing Indian Mountain.
This was to be a fateful decision.
The walk was relatively easy, and the campsite turned out to be superb, but despite this good fortune, our Hiking Associate began unraveling.
In a manner eerily similar to that of my ex-girlfriend, she threw the most juvenile temper tantrum I have witnessed in several years, deciding quicker than the fickle wind that me, Jersey Jeff, and my mom--whom she has been calling her "trail mom" since day one--are all "assholes."
According to her, this was because we didn't want to cook directly in our campsites in bear territory.
In reality, we suspect she has a touch of some personality disorder, decided a few days ago that she did not want to continue on the trail, and has constructed an internal fantasy to blame her failure on others.
She decided to go back down the mountain to the shelter; she ostensibly intends to leave the trail tomorrow.
I hope she does.
My mom and Jeff tried to convince her to stay, or at least walk back with someone.
I did not.
I knew this was coming thanks to my two and a half years of dreadful, regrettable experience with my ex, and I was happy to let the energy of her explosion carry her far from us.
As she made her final arrangements to depart, my mom and I followed some cheerful beerlads to the summit of the mountain.
We stood and chatted with them and a nice couple camping there as the sun drifted down the open sky.
It shone through wispy clouds and made lakes glow until endless mountains hid it from our view.
I've seen many sunsets;
this one was the most exhilarating.
The lifting of our greatest burden made it that much sweeter.
</p>
<p>
<h2>324 546 768 98A, Windy Starry Twilight of the End of the Day</h2>
A breakfast of ice cream marked the start of our loftiest day so far.
We found ourselves intermittently in the company of a Kentucky man who calls himself
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@garysnextadventure">Papa Bear</a>;
he comes from a dirt-poor family, but by some fluke of genetics wound up being a leftist, so he is estranged from his siblings and hates his state.
As morning became afternoon, we drew ever closer to the first nation-state border of the trail.
Just before reaching it I had the good fortune to discover a recently felled laurel suitable for use as a walk-mobile device, and with some frantic secret sawing it became mine to keep.
At last, beneath the hot southern sun, we crossed the Official Georga-Carolinia State Limen Marker Plaque, complete with a user-submitted line in the dirt.
Not 30 yards later we came to our campsite.
We consumed some genuine Knorr trail slop with the Ursine Father and his Yale-grad hikin' bud, who calls herself Bluebird.
As we cleaned and wiped our messy slimy food pots, a mother strolled by with 13 of her 15 children.
Don't worry--we captured them on camera.
After a trip to the special tree for sunfall, we retired;
just now BearDad's third ally has arrived at camp.
He ought to stake down his tent well, because this night is foretold to bring with it some foul weather.
</p>
<p>
<h2>3/23/23/23/23/23, The Same Time Of Day As Almost Every Other One Of These Entries</h2>
Two bard owls punctuated last night's rainfall with their frenzied song.
Perhaps they were laughing as we slept.
The morning was gloriously dry; a brief jog down the mountain brought us to our NASA-approved transportation device, which swung us Around The Bend to tonight's hôtel.
This hôtel occupies an intermediate position on the hotel-hôtel spectrum.
It's not a crack house, which is a plus, but it is still rather communal and chaotically run.
Our host is John Lennon from circa 1970.
He seems to have acquired some customs on his 1968 Indian Approprition Expedition, in particular the endlessly fascinating diagonal head bobble that accompanies every spoken word.
We managed to hitch a ride on a crewed ISS resupply into town, which ejected us at the least convenient possible location to go shopping.
A couple highway crossings later and we nonetheless had all the nummy munchies we need for the big days ahead.
We gobbled up a geriatrically early supper out on the town, followed by a spot of iced cream, and returned to the hot hôtel, where I bought a carbon fiber compliant-mechanism umbrella (fancy variety).
We also nabbed a couple larger stuffel bags for our hangbeds, which should make packing up less strenuous.
There are promises of a continental breakfast in the morning--very European.
If we survive tomorrow's climb I pinkie swear to write again.
Love, Your Big Wet Teddy Bear

<h2>Three Twenty Two, Electric Boogaloo, 6:25 Named Clive</h2>
After the sun set last night, I was treated to a view of distant city lights, at once inspiring awe and reminding me of the industrial creep that threatens my future property.
I dreamt about a fictitious episode of Black Mirror, a show I have never seen and know almost nothing about, until my sleep was briefly disrupted by some earlier-than-forecast rain.
It tinkled as we packed our things, as we mudsurfed for miles, and as we arrived at tonight's wooden structure of habitation and erected our flies.
A break in the great drip allowed us to hang the bed bananas without moistening them, but it soon resumed, so we resigned to heating and eating our Trail Slop cuisine with the huddled sleepers-to-be.
More progress was made towards astroturfing that term into the public consciousness.
One of the sheltermen tonight is a familiar face; he is stout and bearded, smokes a pipe, and calls himself Furlong.
He is from "Nahampsha."
The day is not yet waning, but still sleep nears.
Becoming dry will be a puzzle.
If the worst should befall us we will be in another hôtel next afternoon.

<h2>3/21 = 1/7 haha fraction gag, the Part of the Day After Dinner but Before You Finish Staking Your Rain Fly</h2>
Steep day, very steep.
Steep step.
Down a mountain, up a mountain, down a mountain, up a mountain.
Seedle peeled off after the first descent on account of her fucked leg;
as she did so, we became acquainted with Smoky the Bear, who gave us his number.
Then we carried on.
Several of the strutters we encountered on the way to our destination are holing up next to us tonight--a rowdier bunch than I would have, but hopefully they will shut their holes before too long.
They say little of note anyway, except for a seasoned man who calls himself K-Dog.
He amuses me.
The sun has withdrawn behind the clouds and mountains, but continues to illuminate the sprawling, rolling landscape below our ridge, making it glow as a field of wheat at harvest time.
A blue jay's feather graces our ground.
My name is John Muir, and you're reading Nature Words, Overused Quotes, and Other Forgotten Ramblings, Volume 37.

<h2>Springe's Firstest Day, Looming Scungset</h2>
You know what they say: after two longs, a short must follow.
Nowhere is this truer than in the backcountry.
We slept in and schlepped out a brief seven mighles at record pace, thanks to the mild terraigne and absence of our burdenous Hiking Associate for most of the trip.
Snacks were eaten.
Our fabric accomodations are strung up this evening on a ridge overlook at the 50 mile increment marking indicator sigil;
we are joined by several surprisingly tolerable people, including two oldies and one mildly injured young lass whom I will call Seedle.
We expect her to join our wayfaring party on the morrow as she fares down the gap to rest up her knee.
Each day now the air warms, and if the big luck dealer stays on our side of the court it should be an easy few stints into the next town.

<h2>Threem Nimeteem, the End of a Gentle Pink Sunset</h2>
Today was a big day for us.
Not a Big Boy day--that will have to wait a couple months--but still our biggest day so far.
It was also very TrailMagical ;) !
Two separate bands of warlocks assembled to provide us with yummy eatins and a scrumptious dessert treat.
They even gifted us an incantation.
Before, between, and after these lil rests, we went up and down, up and down, lots.
Two more lads entered our orbital periphery: one who calls himself White Oak, and one who I will call Jersey Jeff.
With their unwitting aid, we were able to spend much of the day out of hearing range of our Hiking Associate, who has of late begun calling herself Squeeze.
May tomorrow be similarly quiet.
Near the end of the day, a guardian presented us with a fork in the road.
We took the right path.
Now, with plump tummies and emptied bladders, we hunker down for another bitterly cold night.
</p>

<h2>3/18 = 1/6, so it is "Insurrection" Day, at It Smells Like Fucking Cigarettes In This Bunk House o'clock</h2>
I am in an insane place.
I don't throw that term around willee nillee; people, places, and things have to earn the designation.
This place has done so beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Our hike today was not as difficult as I was anticipating--a recurring trend, it seems, methinks, it would appear.
We found the top of an early hill to be frosted, with ice growing sideways off stems and branches under the force of the wind.
On our approach to Blood Mountain, we came across two middle-aged southbound women warning us that the climb ahead was "a sheet of ice" with winds "easily 20 miles an hour."
They told us we needed to take the bypass trail.
They were "saving lives left and right today."
When I ascertained that they had not in fact been on the mountain, I began to doubt their claims.
We decided to ignore them and pressed on, finding the conditions balmy and whimsical.
Atlantis could be sighted from the summit.
A steep descent carried us to a disgraceful tourist gift shop full of trinkets and useless plastic doodads;
to make matters worse, a group of three inbred hicks who had been harassing our Hiking Associate earlier in the day were sitting outside drinking monster and beer.
Fortunately,we absconded away with our resupply boxes and caught our NASA shuttle to tonight's hôtel.
Arriving, it became immediately clear that last night's hôtel was really more on the hotel end of the spectrum.
This place is a genuine hôtel.
I spent a fair amount of the evening in a loaner shirt with an atomic structure diagram of LSD on it;
my mother, our Hiking Associate, a fellow inhabiter, and one of the owners all donned onezies;
an overweight man in his 50s and a fluorescent yellow beanie would not shut up (he is currently on the bunk below me, finally quiet);
a bearded old smoker in a cowboy hat lurked mute until he finally muttered "that's too funny";
a profoundly, inexplicably, indescribably, frighteningly weird couple(?) from Illinois(?) who we passed on our first day arrived (one is very thin with his(?) long hair in a bun, the other does not talk and turns his head very slowly like the weird kid you saw in gym in high school and can't remember the name of);
the whole house appears normal at first glance, but the longer you spend in it the more it becomes clear that all of the interior decorating and arranging is the product of weed- and shroom-addled minds, slowly infecting you with their cluttered but tasteful psychosis, driving you to dissociation.
I swear to the Anointed Christ Geesus on the Rood that I am not making any of this up.
Which reminds me, the place is Christian.
Christian LSD: the new aesthetic of the southern Appalachians.
I am done for the night.

<h2>Kiss an IRA Bomber Day, Lights Out Time for the Kiddos</h2>
Today was a wet day, as in there was a lot of water making things wet.
The water was coming from God.
God managed to get many things wet, including my feet, but our UltraTech Synthetic Dyneeema Dry Tarp Rainproof BPA-free* Fly Covers protected the essential goods and services.
After a short jaunt of 4.08 nautical miles, we recruited the remains of NASA's failed Space Shuttle program to ferry us to a hôtel.
Our driver was a congenial and pleasant interlocutor.
At the accommodations we enjoyed Pope John's 16-incher and hung some moist ones in the closet.
And the best part is: we get to stay in a hôtel again tamorrow!
I'm really looking forward to experiencing these back to back new experiences.
There are hôtels all over the fucking place!
I must also make two addenda to yestaday's report.
First, my number one priority goal mission on the trail--astroturfing "trail slop" into an accepted term for trail food--began last night as a beautifully smooth opportunity to "coin" the term was handed to me by Knox.
This gives me hope for the future.
And second, I recieved an ancient First Nations blessing while setting up my hammock in the form of a golden Sacagawea in the dirt.
I may only be $1 richer, but my spiritual wealth has exploded tenfold.
May the good vibes and energy wiggles propagate into the morning, when we shall attempt our biggest day yet and cross Blood Mountain (blood sacrifice optional but strongly encouraged).
</p>

<h2>16/3, Starry Late Eve</h2>
We were generously serenaded last night by a pack of coyotes engaged in spirited debate.
Their vocalizations lulled us into a deep sleep.
After waking this morning and beginning our quotidian labor, we found that our orbit of leapfroggers had at once been sundered and grown.
The Homonyms and The Lovers fell a bit behind our pace, and three lads filled the power vacuum: one who calls himself Chopsticks, and two who I will refer to as Haverford and Knox.
Amidst the echoes of machine gun fire, Chopsticks warned us of the coming storm; we ignored him until the schizophrenic meteorological prognosticators confirmed his fears, then elected to cut tomorrow short and take cover in a hôtel.
Our late afternoon was spent mostly in a dusty forest, where Haverford and Knox made a few stabs at appellating me Stylin' or Einstein--I successfully rebuffed their advances.
We have come to rest a few hundred feet downslope of the communal shelter our Hiking Associate elected to inhabit, so the night is pleasantly calm.
I look forward to a wet morning that should put our gears and cogs to the exam.
</p>

<h2>Assassination Day, the First White Blaze Nightfall</h2>
Our morning began with a climb up Mound Springus to the southerlimost terminad of the trail proper.
I am rapidly coming to understand that the average fitness of Mainewalk attempters is much lower than you might otherwise expect;
the difficulty of trail segments is consistently overreported, and we seem to pass others frequently.
On a brighter side, our Hiking Association has agglomerated two pair of ragtag rapscallions as intermittent stroll buddies.
One I will refer to as The Homonyms, and the other as The Lovers.
We encountered our first Wizard in a parking lot, who called himself Doc Holliday and could conjure food items from an automobile;
permuted amongst ourselves through the length of a lush grove of laurels, rhododendra, and virgin hemlock;
and paused to enjoy the roar of a strange and rare formation in which a creek rapdily changes altitude and the water apears to fall.
We now retire nestled on a sloping but well-constructed series of tent flats and hammock nooks.
Dinner was warm.
</p>

<h2>Pie in the Calendrical Sky, the Part of the Day When It Is Cold</h2>
Reports of Amicalola Stairs' difficulty were greatly exaggerated.
I'm not sure how unfit you'd have to be to struggle with them, but suffice to say you shouldn't be hiking.
We enjoyed a leisurely stroll up them after receiving our TrailSat Wireless Tracking Number Tag Registration Card from the relevant agency, and in the process came to meet our first official Hiking Associate.
She is like a cross between my ex-girlfriend and my best friend's youngest sister, except she's ten years older than them.
We hiked and waddled, climbed and philosophized, tumbled and scrumbled.
This evening we performed an initiatory fire ritual with the sundry hippies, scrappy retirees, vagrants, locutionary wizards, and bona fide trekkers inhabiting our campsite.
It was grand.
As I write now, it is a crispy 34 Fahrenheits, and the ashes of our creation smolder beneath a gently occident sun.
A long night awaits.
</p>

<h2>three/thirteen, Gettin' Ready for Beddy</h2>
I just finished watching an hour-long video on electrolyte balance at the request of my mother.
I gained no significant insight from this experience; I plan to retain my habit of getting electro-lit roughly once a day.
Juice taste good, Cole like juice.
Nothing remains to be done before our departure in the morning.
Our lodge overlooks the falls we will be climbing after completing our pack weigh-in and No Touch Only Look orientation session at the visitor center.
660 stairs are rumored to lie between there and here.
We will do our best, but I cannot guarantee the continued existence of our legs and cardiovascular systems after climbing them.
We plan to trek a leisurely 7 miles to ease us into the groove, or rhythm, also known as habitary custom.
The serene eve bodes well, I think.
Let me know what you think.
What do you think, reading person?
Do you think the serene eve bodes well?
I do.

<h2>Twelmar, Post-Supper Stupor</h2>
Someone should alert the authorities that France and the Live Oak Militia are launching an all-out assault on the southeastern seaboard.
There's sous vide, crème brûlée, défenêtrations nônchâlântes, waxy green leaves all over our beautiful hardwood floors - this miscarriage of justice cannot stand.
Fortunately, we pooled our meager intellects in the manner of congress and arrived at a plan to retaliate with our mouths and a screened-in porch.
The latest reports from the front indicate that the enemy was successfully neutralized.
We should all take away the following lesson from this experience: the mouth is a powerful and dextrous tool apt for many diverse persuasions and persuasive acts.
Beyond battle, not much happened today.
I self-administered some cognitive evaluations and confimed my longstanding suspicion that I am severely impaired.
Probably there is no hope for me; my mind rots and rots from hour to hour like that of so many men my age.
At least Papa Fed is bailing out all the friendly California executives who have only our best interest in mind.
Thank you, Tim Apple!
Thank you, Algore!
Thank you, Jay Powell!
Say this prayer three times, then take the seed underfoot and shake a twig of birch.
After six days, six hours, and six minutes, the crop will be genetically modified.

<h2>3/11, Early Evening as the Pearl-Sun is Weaning</h2>
We are atop a large building overlooking town from a distance.
A well-timed jump from this height could take out at least two groundwalkers, maybe three.
The day has been marked by time travel:
we began with a trip to Rhode Island in 1952, where we discovered that Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings;
then we leapfrogged to a near-future hellscape where all manner of goblins, ghouls, "artists," pigs in strollers, dyed-hair agitators, horsecops, and complacent shoppers gather at something called a "farmers' market";
and lastly, craving a return to stately tradition, we transported ourselves back to the good old past and enjoyed some ice cream cones Biden-style.
What the evening will bring is yet to be determined.
I do know that bananas will be involved, at least in spirit.
The spirit of bananas is strong here. Their joy and unreserved expression of self is something rarely seen in people their age.
We should all be more like bananas.
More from me tomorrow, when the crew gets the whole gang together and eats as a team.
</p>
<p>
<h2>10 Marsh 2023hree, late in the late part of the day</h2>
Tonight we consulted with a psychic at an old vault.
She had nothing whatsoever of import to say about our trip.
Maybe next time.
There were a number of odd synchronicities, coincidences, and fun little joyous moments, however, which point me to order a taco from a restaurant in Radnor in the fall.
Then the craving shall be quenched, and we shall see what it is all about.
As the day of departure, or d-day as I like to call it, draws nearer to the present moment, in that strange manner in which time draws and creeps and keeps,
I think to myself, as I so often do in these moments and those like them, such as before other major times of departure, movement, or change, for instance my starting collage, or the other time,
that, in this manner and nearing quickly like a freight train, barreling at me like a truck, rushing at me like a large solid object moving at high speed, which frequently happens.
I think those who can will know what a companion this can be for such a man.
This one is a poem: O great spirit in the night, keep the stary sky so bright, like a glowing glitter cup, to distract my grandfather from his dog that will not shut up
</p>

<h2>Marche the Ninth, Sultry Midafternoon</h2>
I am in the middle of a nearly twelve-hour car ride travelling the distance we intend to hike in about 90 days.
Cars are faster than people.
I've just discovered the existence of Arizona Fruit Snacks, the packaging of which will make a fine and dandy addition to my growing Arizona Tarot.
I believe the Snacks are almost three times as expensive as a classic can; they don't taste like it.
The checkerboard motif reoccurs once again on the top of the bag.
I am convinced it is speaking to me.
It is saying, "summersummersummersummersummersummer."
It speaks in whispers and hisses, but I can still hear it if I strain my cochlea.
Summersummersummersummersummersummer.
