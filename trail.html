<h1>The Great Walk</h1>
<p>
<h2>Assassination Day, the First White Blaze Nightfall</h2>
Our morning began with a climb up Mound Springus to the southerlimost terminad of the trail proper.
I am rapidly coming to understand that the average fitness of Mainewalk attempters is much lower than you might otherwise expect;
the difficulty of trail segments is consistently overreported, and we seem to pass others frequently.
On a brighter side, our Hiking Association has agglomerated two pair of ragtag rapscallions as intermittent stroll buddies.
One I will refer to as The Homonyms, and the other as The Lovers.
We encountered our first Wizard in a parking lot, who called himself Doc Holliday and could conjure food items from an automobile;
permuted amongst ourselves through the length of a lush grove of laurels, rhododendra, and virgin hemlock;
and paused to enjoy the roar of a strange and rare formation in which a creek rapdily changes altitude and the water apears to fall.
We now retire nestled on a sloping but well-constructed series of tent flats and hammock nooks.
Dinner was warm.

<h2>Pie in the Calendrical Sky, the Part of the Day When It Is Cold</h2>
Reports of Amicalola Stairs' difficulty were greatly exaggerated.
I'm not sure how unfit you'd have to be to struggle with them, but suffice to say you shouldn't be hiking.
We enjoyed a leisurely stroll up them after receiving our TrailSat Wireless Tracking Number Tag Registration Card from the relevant agency, and in the process came to meet our first official Hiking Associate.
She is like a cross between my ex-girlfriend and my best friend's youngest sister, except she's ten years older than them.
We hiked and waddled, climbed and philosophized, tumbled and scrumbled.
This evening we performed an initiatory fire ritual with the sundry hippies, scrappy retirees, vagrants, locutionary wizards, and bona fide trekkers inhabiting our campsite.
It was grand.
As I write now, it is a crispy 34 Fahrenheits, and the ashes of our creation smolder beneath a gently occident sun.
A long night awaits.

<h2>three/thirteen, Gettin' Ready for Beddy</h2>
I just finished watching an hour-long video on electrolyte balance at the request of my mother.
I gained no significant insight from this experience; I plan to retain my habit of getting electro-lit roughly once a day.
Juice taste good, Cole like juice.
Nothing remains to be done before our departure in the morning.
Our lodge overlooks the falls we will be climbing after completing our pack weigh-in and No Touch Only Look orientation session at the visitor center.
660 stairs are rumored to lie between there and here.
We will do our best, but I cannot guarantee the continued existence of our legs and cardiovascular systems after climbing them.
We plan to trek a leisurely 7 miles to ease us into the groove, or rhythm, also known as habitary custom.
The serene eve bodes well, I think.
Let me know what you think.
What do you think, reading person?
Do you think the serene eve bodes well?
I do.

<h2>Twelmar, Post-Supper Stupor</h2>
Someone should alert the authorities that France and the Live Oak Militia are launching an all-out assault on the southeastern seaboard.
There's sous vide, crème brûlée, défenêtrations nônchâlântes, waxy green leaves all over our beautiful hardwood floors - this miscarriage of justice cannot stand.
Fortunately, we pooled our meager intellects in the manner of congress and arrived at a plan to retaliate with our mouths and a screened-in porch.
The latest reports from the front indicate that the enemy was successfully neutralized.
We should all take away the following lesson from this experience: the mouth is a powerful and dextrous tool apt for many diverse persuasions and persuasive acts.
Beyond battle, not much happened today.
I self-administered some cognitive evaluations and confimed my longstanding suspicion that I am severely impaired.
Probably there is no hope for me; my mind rots and rots from hour to hour like that of so many men my age.
At least Papa Fed is bailing out all the friendly California executives who have only our best interest in mind.
Thank you, Tim Apple!
Thank you, Algore!
Thank you, Jay Powell!
Say this prayer three times, then take the seed underfoot and shake a twig of birch.
After six days, six hours, and six minutes, the crop will be genetically modified.

<h2>3/11, Early Evening as the Pearl-Sun is Weaning</h2>
We are atop a large building overlooking town from a distance.
A well-timed jump from this height could take out at least two groundwalkers, maybe three.
The day has been marked by time travel:
we began with a trip to Rhode Island in 1952, where we discovered that Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings;
then we leapfrogged to a near-future hellscape where all manner of goblins, ghouls, "artists," pigs in strollers, dyed-hair agitators, horsecops, and complacent shoppers gather at something called a "farmers' market";
and lastly, craving a return to stately tradition, we transported ourselves back to the good old past and enjoyed some ice cream cones Biden-style.
What the evening will bring is yet to be determined.
I do know that bananas will be involved, at least in spirit.
The spirit of bananas is strong here. Their joy and unreserved expression of self is something rarely seen in people their age.
We should all be more like bananas.
More from me tomorrow, when the crew gets the whole gang together and eats as a team.

<h2>10 Marsh 2023hree, late in the late part of the day</h2>
Tonight we consulted with a psychic at an old vault.
She had nothing whatsoever of import to say about our trip.
Maybe next time.
There were a number of odd synchronicities, coincidences, and fun little joyous moments, however, which point me to order a taco from a restaurant in Radnor in the fall.
Then the craving shall be quenched, and we shall see what it is all about.
As the day of departure, or d-day as I like to call it, draws nearer to the present moment, in that strange manner in which time draws and creeps and keeps,
I think to myself, as I so often do in these moments and those like them, such as before other major times of departure, movement, or change, for instance my starting collage, or the other time,
that, in this manner and nearing quickly like a freight train, barreling at me like a truck, rushing at me like a large solid object moving at high speed, which frequently happens.
I think those who can will know what a companion this can be for such a man.
This one is a poem: O great spirit in the night, keep the stary sky so bright, like a glowing glitter cup, to distract my grandfather from his dog that will not shut up

<h2>Marche the Ninth, Sultry Midafternoon</h2>
I am in the middle of a nearly twelve-hour car ride travelling the distance we intend to hike in about 90 days.
Cars are faster than people.
I've just discovered the existence of Arizona Fruit Snacks, the packaging of which will make a fine and dandy addition to my growing Arizona Tarot.
I believe the Snacks are almost three times as expensive as a classic can; they don't taste like it.
The checkerboard motif reoccurs once again on the top of the bag.
I am convinced it is speaking to me.
It is saying, "summersummersummersummersummersummer."
It speaks in whispers and hisses, but I can still hear it if I strain my cochlea.
Summersummersummersummersummersummer.
