<h1>The Great Walk</h1>

<h2>10 Marsh 2023hree, late in the late part of the day</h2>
Tonight we consulted with a psychic at an old vault.
She had nothing whatsoever of import to say about our trip.
Maybe next time.
There were a number of odd synchronicities, coincidences, and fun little joyous moments, however, which point me to order a taco from a restaurant in Radnor in the fall.
Then the craving shall be quenched, and we shall see what it is all about.
As the day of departure, or d-day as I like to call it, draws nearer to the present moment, in that strange manner in which time draws and creeps and keeps,
I think to myself, as I so often do in these moments and those like them, such as before other major times of departure, movement, or change, for instance my starting collage, or the other time,
that, in this manner and nearing quickly like a freight train, barreling at me like a truck, rushing at me like a large solid object moving at high speed, which frequently happens.
I think those who can will know what a companion this can be for such a man.
This one is a poem: O great spirit in the night, keep the stary sky so bright, like a glowing glitter cup, to distract my grandfather from his dog that will not shut up

<h2>Marche the Ninth, Sultry Midafternoon</h2>
I am in the middle of a nearly twelve-hour car ride travelling the distance we intend to hike in about 90 days.
Cars are faster than people.
I've just discovered the existence of Arizona Fruit Snacks, the packaging of which will make a fine and dandy addition to my growing Arizona Tarot.
I believe the Snacks are almost three times as expensive as a classic can; they don't taste like it.
The checkerboard motif reoccurs once again on the top of the bag.
I am convinced it is speaking to me.
It is saying, "summersummersummersummersummersummer."
It speaks in whispers and hisses, but I can still hear it if I strain my cochlea.
Summersummersummersummersummersummer.
